      <h1 id="breaking-bagit">Breaking Bag(It)</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This activity revolves around the Open Archival Information System (OAIS), information packages, and the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8493">Library of Congress BagIt Specification</a>.</p>

<p>In this activity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will first act as the “producer” (as defined by the OAIS model) and take steps to prepare a <strong>Submission Information Package (SIP)</strong>.</li>
  <li>For this exercise, your SIP will be implemented using the BagIt specification. Think of your BagIt bag as a concrete example of a SIP (note, SIP and bag, for this activity, will be used interchangeably)</li>
  <li>Once you’ve prepped your SIP (bag), you will hand it over to me for processing. I will create:
    <ol>
      <li>A valid BagIt-conforming SIP (good bag).</li>
      <li>A deliberately altered, broken SIP (bad bag).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your goal will be to troubleshoot and document what went wrong with the bad bag.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<h3 id="1-upload-bag-contents">1. Upload bag contents</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Open the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U1Va5o9ksyrg5yBtqL8RAOe5Y8OttCwX?usp=sharing">Breaking Bag Google Drive folder</a> and within it, create a new folder titled your first name, underscore, and last name (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mary_kidd</code>).</li>
  <li>Within your personal folder, create a subfolder within it and title it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">original_files</code>.</li>
  <li>Upload <em>at least</em> five files of your choice to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">original_files</code> folder. These can be any files you want (please avoid large files like audio/video files, if possible!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-bag-creation">2. Bag Creation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Once you have created your folders and uploaded files into it, let me know (if we are in class, let me know verbally; otherwise, if this happens outside of class, send me an email).</li>
  <li>I will use the <a href="https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python">bagit-python</a> script on my computer to transform your folder into a BagIt-compliant Submission Information Package (SIP).</li>
  <li>I will upload <strong>two versions</strong> of your newly-minted SIPs/bags to your Google Drive folder, to allow you to compare a valid SIP/bag with an intentionally corrupted one:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Your good SIP/bag</strong> – named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yourfirstname_yourlastname_good_bag</code></li>
      <li><strong>Your broken SIP/bag</strong> – named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yourfirstname_yourlastname_bad_bag</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-review-each-bag">3. Review Each Bag</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I will notify you (either verbally in class, or by email) that your SIPs/bags are ready. Once this happens, open both the good and bad SIPs/bags. Your task is to examine the contents of each and try to identify how they are broken.</li>
  <li>Some changes may be obvious, while others may be subtle. You may need to look at certain files within the SIP/bag, like the manifest, to determine what went wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-submit-your-activity-summary-in-brightspace">4. Submit your activity summary in Brightspace</h3>

<p>In the Assignments section of Brightspace, please prepare and attach a document with your answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What do you think I altered?</li>
  <li>What did you examine to figure this out? What clues did you find that told you something went wrong?</li>
  <li><em>Optional:</em> If you couldn’t find exactly what went wrong, were there any differences, in general, between the two SIP/bags, that you noticed? What were they?</li>
  <li>From a broader perspective, what rules or policies might a repository put in place to ensure data submitted to it is in tact?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-discuss-your-findings-in-class">5. Discuss your findings in class</h3>

<p>Come prepared for Week 3’s class to spend 2-3 minutes discussing your experience investigating what went wrong. I will also reveal to you what I altered, so you can compare your findings with my doings!</p>
