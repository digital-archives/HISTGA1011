Inventory Spreadsheet Guidance . Note: Any columns highlighted in yellow within the Inventory spreadsheet are the sections you will be filling out. Pre-populated field definitions: . | Series: Name of finding aid series containing the folder. | Box number: Box label number. Since this is a folder-level list, box numbers may repeat themselves. | Folder number: Folder label number | Content Estimate Count: Estimated total count of Content Estimate Format. | Content Estimate Format: Format of Content Estimate Count | Restrictions: Access restriction statement/dates. | Condition: Noted conservation issues. | . Fields (highlighted in yellow) to be filled for each folder: . | Workflow Type(s): Use the Harvard Library Imaging Services Project Services Categories (HLIS) site to categorize workflow type(s) for each folder. | Folder Name: Enter each folder‚Äôs name based on the file-naming schema described in your Report. | Capture Device: Based on your workflow selections from the HLIS site, identify the capture device you will need to digitize each folder. Use the Harvard to DLF Capture Device Table below, which maps HLIS Workflow to DLF Calculator Device. | Shot Count: For each folder listed, enter in an estimated shot count based on the Content Estimate Count and Format. | Imaging Time: Using the DLF Digitization Cost Calculator, calculate the time it will take per workflow type in minutes. To determine these estimates, open the Calculator and enter the following details: . | Number of scans: Enter total number shots in the folder with the same workflow (sort the worksheet by Content Estimate). If you are using multiple workflows for 1 folder, you need to calculate time separately then add together. | Staffing: List each staff name (enter their role here, no need to make up a name), type (hourly or salaried is fine), rate (guess!), and benefits (enter 20%) | Capture Device: Select the capture device you listed in the Inventory (see the Harvard to DLF Capture Device Table). | Preparation of Original Material . | Condition review: 100 | Fastener removal: [leave blank] | Sorting material into items: [leave blank] | Rights review: [leave blank] | Make sure for each, select the staff performing these tasks. | . | Quality Control . | Select Level 1 | Percentage of Material: 10% (feel free to adjust this!) | Make sure for each, select the staff performing these tasks. | . | Post Processing: [skip] | Metadata: Select level 3 and input 32% for the percentage for material | Post Preparation: [skip] | Other: [skip] | Select ‚ÄúSave and Continue‚Äù; input the total in minutes per Content Estimate Count/Format/Workflow type | . | .

If you are unsure based on the HLIS info, select ‚ÄúManual DSLR‚Äù. | Output File Type(s): Identify the resulting preservation file types for the digitized material using the Library of Congress Recommended Formats as your guide (ignore the output options from the HLIS site.) Don‚Äôt worry about what the output of particular cameras or scanners are, since some output raw images; instead, focus your decision-making on the final output and assume any necessary conversion will occur during post-production. | Resolution: Express in DPI (dots per inch). General recommendations are: . | 300 dpi: optimal for most material (good balance between detail capture and file size) | 400 dpi: more detailed capture, consider for photography | 600 dpi: small items, a lot of detail | . | OCR (Y/N): Do you want optical character recognition? Make sure you include this in the cost. | Cost: Based on your selected workflows and shot counts, calculate the cost of digitization per folder using the costs per image listed in the Harvard Library Imaging Services Project Services Categories site. | . Report Guidance . | Collection Name: | Group members: | Scope: Using your Inventory, summarize what and how much you will be digitizing. | Workflow: Write out a step-by-step workflow that provides instructions for how collection items will be scanned/photographed (bullet point is fine). This workflow should be easily understood by the staff performing the digitization. | Selection criteria: Since there will be both overarching decisions and folder-specific decisions due to different item types, document why you selected or prioritized some or all folders, or excluded any material from digitization and why. | File- and folder-naming schema: Assume your imaging output will be grouped by folder for post-production processing. What is the folder naming schema you will give to the batch folders? What information do you want to capture in the folder name? Provide your reasoning. | Staff: List each staff and their role in your project. | Output file type(s): Summarize the file formats output as a result of digitization. | Estimated shot count total: Provide total across all folders in your Inventory‚Äôs ‚ÄúShot Count‚Äù column. | Estimated Imaging Time (minutes) total: Provide total across all folders in your Inventory‚Äôs ‚ÄúImaging Time‚Äù column. | Estimated project cost: __Provide total cost across all folders in your Inventory‚Äôs ‚ÄúCost‚Äù column. | Estimated production length: Take the total amount of minutes listed in your inventory and convert into something more tangible, like days, weeks or months. | Full project notes and approaches: Document the project-wide decisions you make and why. Folder-specific decisions should be documented at the folder level, but so you don‚Äôt need to repeat information at the folder level, document it here: What file format(s) did you select and why? Are there blanket digitization decisions you made, such as no blank versos? Etc. | Conservation Notes: Detail what sort of conservation or stabilization treatments may be required for materials with condition issues, and comment on how this might affect production length or any other project details. | .

Provide a summary of your collection‚Äôs form and extent. | Describe the collection (formats, volume, content types) | What is in scope for digitization | What is out of scope (e.g., commercial recordings, duplicate materials) | Link to the finding aid or catalog record, if available | . 5. Selection Criteria &amp; Prioritization . Describe the order in which materials will be digitized, considering the institution‚Äôs existing access methods, technological limitations, and institutional priorities. Identify any challenges in the current system that may impact digitization workflows or user access. Considerations may include: . | Format and condition | Copyright and legal restrictions | Dependence on specific hardware/software | Other institutional priorities | . 6. Preservation Approach . Describe your methodology and cite national standards and best practices where applicable. If you depart from existing practices, explain why and how your approach remains interoperable. 7. End-to-End Workflow . Outline the full workflow for your project, covering: . | Acquisition and accessioning | Archival processing, appraisal, and description | Digitization preparation (in-house or vendor-based) | Digital repository ingestion and file storage | Additional processing (OCR, auto-transcription, normalization, QC, rights clearance) | Long-term preservation strategies (backups, data integrity, disaster planning) | . 8. Discovery, Access &amp; Use . Explain how users currently access materials at your institution. Identify limitations (e.g., discoverability, user experience, metadata structure). Compare access models at other institutions and discuss how similar approaches could improve your institution‚Äôs access strategy, or suggest improvements to the user experience, features, and functionality. Ensure this section aligns with any visualizations/diagrams/workflows in the appendix and in your presentation. 9. Technical Specifications &amp; Standards . | Software and hardware: Identify tools used in the workflow | File formats: Define submission, preservation, and access formats | Resolution and sample rates: Outline minimum standards for digitized files | Quality control: Describe how files will be assessed | Metadata: Identify schemas for descriptive, administrative, preservation, technical, and access/catalog metadata | Access platform: Explain how users will interact with the collection | Rights and restrictions: Discuss potential copyright or privacy concerns | . 10. Front-End Experience . Describe who your intended users are and how they will engage with the collection. Consider: . | User characteristics and needs | Features that will support discovery and access | Format-specific requirements (e.g., audio players for digitized tapes) | How the digital experience will replicate or enhance the physical experience | . This section should align with your mockup in the appendix. 11. Anticipated Challenges &amp; Risk Mitigation . Identify potential obstacles and how you plan to address them, including: . | Material-specific challenges | Workflow or policy gaps | Budget and resource constraints | Technical limitations | Sustainability concerns | Legal or rights-based risks | .

    "content": "Why scripting? . With the pace at which institutions are acquiring born-digital materials, or digitizing analog materials, archivists often encounter tasks that are otherwise very time-consuming or ultra tedious to perform manually. Scripting is sometimes turned to as a way to do things quickly and accurately, at scale. Scripts have been written by archivists, some who are seasoned developers, others who are not. While you don‚Äôt need to be a full-fledged programmer to work in a modern repository, having a basic understanding of what scripting can do can help you to at least imagine ways to better automate and manage repetitive processes. For this activity, you‚Äôll explore a real-life example of code used by a repository and translate it into pseudocode. Think of pseudocode as plain, conversational language that explains the steps a script takes to accomplish its task. ",

    "title": "Steps",
    "content": "1. Select a script . | In class, you‚Äôll choose one Python* script from Ruth Tillman‚Äôs ArchivesSnake GitHub repository to work with. Each script performs a small job using the Python programming language and the ArchivesSnake Library. Try to choose one that is no more than 50 lines. | A Python script file will end with .py (e.g., download-subjects.py). | . 2. Get to know the script . | Open your chosen script by clicking its name. | Read the script from top to bottom. Don‚Äôt worry at this point about understanding exactly what it‚Äôs doing. This is just a way to get acquainted with its length, any comments made by the author, and see if there‚Äôs anything that initially makes sense. One of Python‚Äôs strengths is that it is written to be more human readable that other scripting languages. Try to find those things! | Ruth conveniently wrote these scripts in ‚Äúchunks‚Äù, in the same way written stories are broken up into paragraphs (with a line break in between each chunk). Try first to hash out what you think the chunk is doing. Note: lines starting with # denote what are known as ‚Äúcomments‚Äù. They‚Äôre there to explain what the code is doing! Please pay special attention to them. There are also descriptions for (some) of the scripts in her main ASpaceASnake page that might also be helpful for you (just please note, not all scripts have a description). | Once you‚Äôve tried out describing what each chunk does, go back and look up terms/script parts that are unfamiliar and fill out your pseudocode. | . 3. Use scripting resources . You are encouraged to use any resource to help you understand the code: . | Documentation (e.g., ArchivesSnake, ArchivesSpace) | Online Communities (e.g., Stack Overflow) | Video Tutorials (e.g., YouTube) | Generative AI (e.g., chatbots) | Cold browser search (e.g. typing in and searching for ‚Äúwhat does [this term/script step] mean?‚Äù in a browser application) | . You don‚Äôt need to cite your sources. The goal is to understand what the script is doing, not to write a formal paper. 4. Write your pseudocode . | Follow the structure from this week‚Äôs slide deck: code on one side, pseudocode on the other. | Example pseudocode: ‚ÄúThis line checks if a folder exists. If it doesn‚Äôt, it creates a folder.‚Äù | . 5. If you‚Äôre confused, pseudo-note it! . If you‚Äôre unsure about any part of the script, it‚Äôs okay! Feel free to note it in your pseudocode: . ‚ÄúI think this line initializes a connection to a server, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure.‚Äù . Uncertainty is part of learning, and you‚Äôre not expected to deeply dissect every detail. When we discuss your findings next week, we can go over parts that confused you. Please note: I will not be grading you on whether or not your pseudocode is correct. Instead, I want to see you made an effort to figure out, on a high-level, what the script was trying to accomplish. 6. Submit your pseudocode . | Spend 1-2 hours tops on this activity. Don‚Äôt overthink it! The point is to try and warm up to what Python code looks like, and learn a little bit more about its syntax and how archivists have used it to do their work. | Submit your pseudocode to Brightspace by Sunday night. | Use clear formatting to separate code from pseudocode for easy readability. Suggestion: Use a two-column ‚Äútable‚Äù using a word processing or slide deck application. | . 7. Prepare to share . Be ready to discuss your pseudocode in class next week. Each student will take 2-3 minutes to discuss: . | What Ruth was trying to accomplish. | What they used to figure out its behavior (web browser search? A #Comment? ArchivesSnake documentation? Asked a student/friend/colleague?). | What was confusing or unclear and why. | Any other takeaways you would like to share. | . ",

Locate the topic titled ‚ÄúWeek [#] - Pre-Class Reading Reactions‚Äù corresponding to the current week. It is essential to submit your weekly post by 3:30 PM on Wednesdays. Your response should encompass all the assigned readings and materials collectively. Ensure that your post includes the following three parts: . | Aha! Share something new that you learned. | What? Mention something that you didn‚Äôt fully understand. | More! Highlight a topic you would like to further discuss in class. | . During our class sessions, we will allocate 10-15 minutes to discuss these reactions as a group. Regarding grading, I will evaluate the completion and quality of your posts each week, focusing on content rather than your writing style. In-class discussions: 10 points . To fully engage in the course, it is expected that you come to class having completed all assigned readings and actively participate in classroom discussions and activities. For weeks when we have guest speakers or field trips, please come prepared with at least one question to ask the speaker. If you are unable to attend class or need to participate remotely, please send an email to me by Wednesday 3:30 PM.
