# Final Project - Digitization Project Abstract, Plan and Presentation: 30 points

**Abstract due (5 points):** February 28, 2024 (Week 6)  
**Project paper (20 points) and presentations (5 points) due:** May 3, 2024 (Week 15)  
**Length for project paper:** 10-12 pages of text plus visual mock-up, and additional appendices as needed.

Utilizing the tools and information we have discussed over the semester, you will propose a digitization project and produce a digitization and access plan.

During the final class, each student will spend approximately 10 minutes presenting their digitization project to the class. Presentations are expected to be accompanied by visuals (such as a slide deck) followed by a brief Q&A afterward. Part of the presentation grade will include asking questions and/or providing feedback during the Q&As for the other students.

An abstract scoping of your project will be due mid-way through the semester. More information on the project and presentation will be shared in class.

**SCENARIO:** You are an archivist working in the special collections department of [organization/institution of your choice] who has decided that one or more collections should be digitized and made accessible to researchers/users in some way. Recognizing your expertise and knowledge in digital preservation workflow management, the Director of Special Collections has appointed you Project Lead. This new role entails driving the development of a comprehensive Digitization Project Plan report, and presenting your findings to your colleagues. The end goal of the report and preservation is to not only convince senior leaders to fund this project but also advocate for the work your department does and garner support for a more robust overall digital preservation program at your institution.

## Goals of the paper and presentation

Writing this report is an opportunity for you to think through a complete digital preservation project and identify and articulate what people, tools, policies, or other resources are needed to put a digital preservation plan into action.

Presenting your findings provides an opportunity for you to practice discussing a project at a high level that speaks to a broad audience and answer questions about your decision-making around digital preservation program planning and management.

Overall, I want to see that you can take the concepts and information we have discussed over the semester and apply them to your own vision for digital preservation program success.

## Presentation

**Length:** 20 minutes (15 minute presentation followed by a 5 minute Q&A)

Presentations should be an overview of your proposed project, highlighting key information, features, and challenges of your project.

You are proposing this project for consideration to the class and professor who will serve as a digital preservation project proposal panel. Following the presentation, the panel will ask follow-up questions to learn more about your project and decisions. This is an opportunity to practice discussing your rationale and decisions based on the project you put together. When serving as a panel member, ask questions to learn more about the project being presented and how the presenter will handle aspects of the project that you may not have come up during the presentation.
