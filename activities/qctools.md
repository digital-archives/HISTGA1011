# QCTools

## Introduction

_This Activity involves downloading and installing a software tool, QCTools, to your computer. If you do not wish to install a software program, please scroll to the bottom of the Activity description to find an alternative Activity to follow. Either Activity works!_

---

In this activity you will be downloading, installing and using QCTools, a program that provides a way to analyze audio/visual transfer “artifacts”.

**Setup steps**
- Install the QCTools program (GUI): <https://bavc.org/programs/preservation/preservation-tools/ target="_blank">
- Download the video clip in the [A/V Preservation shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1im0K8WUMlUDFHWGxE3jDFQ113O6NOtvt) locally. Note: this video was transcoded from a VHS tape.
- Open the <a href="https://sustainableheritagenetwork.org/system/files/atoms/file/QCTools%20Manual%20(Printable%20Version).pdf" target="_blank">Moving Image Preservation of Puget Sound (MIPoPS) QCTools Manual</a>.
- Open the terminal/command line and QCTools in another.

**Activity steps**

_Analyze the video file in QCTools using graphs_

- Open the QCTools program and drag/drop the video file you downloaded. This may take a few seconds to import.

- Play the file back by pressing your Space bar.

- Click the **Filters layout** button.

- Read Ashley Blewer’s slides on filters starting from page #14 to 31 (<https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/qctools.html#14>) (use your right arrow key to navigate). Keep this information handy as you apply more filters to the video file.

- On the left-hand side of the Filters layout, click the filters drop-down and select “Broadcast Range Pixels”. Play the video back and notice what the filter does to the video.

- Apply other filters to your video, such as the Histogram, Oscilloscope, Vectorscope and Waveform (hint: you can check off multiple filters and view them side-by-side, including the original video by selecting “Normal” in the drop-down).

- Notice how the clip has some issues, especially to do with tracking near the beginning.

_Look up a transfer artifact: tracking_

- Open the A/V Artifact Atlas (<http://www.avartifactatlas.com/tags.html>) and click “Browse by format”. Select VHS.

- Click and read through the page about tracking errors, and how to use the QCTools graphs to detect tracking issues (Click the **Setup Filters** button in the top-left of the graphs screen to make sure the appropriate graphs are showing).

- Apply other filters and replay the video. Pay special attention to the parts of the clip with tracking issues. What do the other filters show you when tracking issues occur?

_Review the file’s metadata_

- In QCTools, click the **File list** button to open up a table of data results for your file.

- Open the QCTools cheat sheet: <https://github.com/bavc/qctools-documentation/blob/master/qctools/QCToolsWorkshopCheatSheet.pdf>

- Review the results. Note whether your QCTools report counts were way under, over or average, as far as the QCTools cheat sheet indicates are ideal limits/ranges for certain aspects of the video signal.

**Activity Steps - Alternative**

If you prefer, you can perform an alternative activity that does not involve installing QCTools.

- Download the video clip in the [A/V Preservation shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1im0K8WUMlUDFHWGxE3jDFQ113O6NOtvt) locally. Note: this video was transcoded from a VHS tape.
- Using a video player, watch the video. You will notice immediately that there are some issues with the tape. Note what you observe.
- Open the A/V Artifact Atlas (<http://www.avartifactatlas.com/tags.html>) and click “Browse by Formats”. Select VHS.
- In the list of artifacts that appear, try and find at least 2 artifacts listed that appear in the video. Make note of each.
- Next, visit the <a href="https://archive.org/details/xfrcollective" target="_blank">XFR Collective collection on the Internet Archive</a>. Click around and try and find a digital video transferred from VHS that contains at least one additional artifact. Make note of that as well.

**Prepare to share your findings**
Next class, we will speak together as a group about your experience either using QCTools and/or the A/V Artifact Atlas. In Brightspace, please submit a brief reflection on your experience with this Activity.
