# Data Object

## Activity Overview

For this assignment, you will select a data object and conduct a detailed analysis of its background, development, and usage. Your goal is to explore and articulate the "layers of complexity" required to make the object accessible and understandable, both for humans and machines. 

You will present your findings to the class in a **3-minute lightning talk**, addressing this central question:  
**"In 40 years, when this digital object has become obsolete, what will a future archivist need to extract and preserve the information it contains?"**

By "layers of complexity," consider the components that support access to the object, such as:
- **File formats**: What is the object’s format, and how does it influence usability and preservation?
- **Software**: What tools or programs are needed to open or interact with the object?
- **Hardware**: Are specific devices or environments required for its use or emulation?
- **Knowledge**: What specialized expertise or context would a future archivist need to interpret and preserve its contents?

## Steps

1. **Choose a Data Object**  
   A definition of a data object is available in the <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/slides/week_01_slide_deck.html" target="_blank">Week 1 Slides</a>. Choose a digital file or artifact that interests you and has layers of complexity worth exploring. Examples might include a 3D model file, an old software application, or a video in a niche format.

2. **Document Your Data Object**  
   Open and complete the <a href="https://airtable.com/appX8QYrNyTDJDGmg/pag5PKEZC1XAvye3O/form" target="_blank">Data Object Airtable Form</a>. This will generate a visual "card" in the shared <a href="https://airtable.com/appX8QYrNyTDJDGmg/shrcCl043DAEFMjQe" target="_blank">Airtable gallery</a>, which will be visible to your classmates. Use this card to summarize key details about your chosen object.

3. **Prepare for Next Class**  
   Be ready to deliver a brief, **2–3 minute overview** of your data object, using your Airtable card as a reference. In your overview, address the following:  
   - **Obsolescence**: In 40 years, do you think this object will still be accessible and understandable?  
   - **Archivist’s Needs**: What additional context or resources (e.g., documentation, software, emulators) would a future archivist require to make sense of your object?  
   - **Challenges**: Reflect on technologies from 30-40 years ago—do you anticipate similar hurdles for your object? Will it be easier or harder to work with than today?
