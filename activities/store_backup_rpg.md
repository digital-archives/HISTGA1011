# **üìÇ Store, Backup or Lose: The 3-2-1 Backup RPG**
*A Role-Playing Game About the Importance of Digital Preservation and Disaster Recovery*

## **Premise**
In this short role-playing game (RPG), you and your fellow classmates will take on the role of digital archives professionals at various institutions. Your goal is to **ensure your institution‚Äôs data survives given various constraints.**

To do this, you‚Äôll rely on the **3-2-1 Backup Rule**:  
- **3: Keep at least 3 copies of your data**  
- **2: Use at least two separate devices**  
- **1: Where one copy is stored in a geographically-distinct location**

Following the theme of threes, the class will be divided into three teams, each representing a different institution.

Once assembled, each team should assign out three roles:
- **Roller**: Rolls the dice during each turn
- **Recorder**: Records results and decisions made by the group.
- **Reporter**: Reports results at the end of the RPG.

## **üé≤ Step 1: Roll for your backup setup**
Roller rolls **one six-sided die (1d6)** to determine their backup preparedness. Recorder records the Roll and Backup Setup.

| **Roll** | **Backup Setup** |
|---------|----------------|
| **1** | **"One and Done"**: Only one copy of your data |
| **2-3** | **"Two-for-Two"**: Two copies, both in the same location |
| **4-6** | **"Three's the Charm"**: Three copies, with at least one off-site |

---

## **üèõ Step 2: Roll for your institution type & holdings**
Roll **1d6** to determine what type of institution you are and how much data you need to protect. Recorder records the Roll and Institution Type/Holdings.

| **Roll** | **Institution Type** | **Your Digital Holdings** |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **1** | **Small Museum Archive** | 5 TB of digitized rare photographs |
| **2** | **Public Library** | 50 TB of scanned microfilm |
| **3** | **Small Research Library** | 50 TB of faculty research, dissertations, and special collections |
| **4** | **Film Archive** | 5 PBs of scanned film reels |
| **5** | **National Archive** | 10 PB of government records and multimedia |
| **6** | **Historic Society** | 10 TB of born-digital local oral history audio recordings |

---

## ** Step 3: Roll for your storage solution **

Roll **1d6** as many times as matches your backup setup (e.g., One and Done's roll once; Two-for-Twos twice, and Three's-the-Charm thrice). If you roll the same technology type twice, roll again until you roll a unique. Recorder records the Roll and Storage Solution.

| **Roll** | **Storage Solution**     |
|----------|-----------------------|
| **1**    | Cloud Backup Platform |
| **2**    | On-site RAID          |
| **3**    | Off-site Isilon NAS       |
| **5**    | Linear Tape Open Library |
| **6**    | Drawer of hard drives |

---

## **üî• Step 4: Event**
Roll **1d6 again** to determine an event that befalls your institution. Recorder records the Roll and Event.

| **Roll** | **Disaster Type** | **What Happens** |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1** | **Fixity Failure** | Your morning fixity report warns you that the last day's-worth of preserved data has failed. |
| **2** | **Cyberattack** | Repository software goes offline; IT investigating potential security breach. |
| **3** | **Accidental backup corruption** | A portion of your backup was accidentally overwritten with corrupted data. |
| **4** | **Human error** | A staff member accidentally deletes preservation files in a folder. |
| **5** | **Hardware failure** | One of your devices fails randomly. |
| **6** | **Automation issue** | Backed up files accidentally saved at a non-preservation level resolution. |

## **Confer with your group**

_Review your Backup Setup, Institution Type/Holdings, and Event. Spend 5 minutes talking with your group: how will you respond to the Event to mitigate data loss? Have the Reporter report out to class with their approach._

| **Roll** | **Stroke of luck** |
|---------|-----------------|
| **1-3** | Staff member actually kept a copy of materials on a random desktop: Add this to your backup setup. | 
| **4-6** | Better luck next time! |
