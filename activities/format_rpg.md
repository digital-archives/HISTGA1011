# Format Encounters Role-Playing Game (RPG)

## Objective
This educational game is designed to simulate real-world challenges in digital archives and born-digital content acquisition, specifically during the appraisal and accessioning phases.

## Materials Needed
- One six-sided die (physical or virtual)
- Notebook or digital document for recording observations

## Game Setup
The game consists of three rolls to define a unique digital archiving appraisal/accessioning scenario:
1. Media Type Roll
2. File Format Roll
3. Additional Characteristic Roll

Roll numbers and their results can be found in the [Airtable form](https://airtable.com/appxQkXtRynCqoXF6/pag2or3MimynyQiNO/form).

## Build Your Scenario
1. Open a virtual die program (Google has one that automatically appears if you search for "virtual dice"; but feel free to use whatever program you wish, or an analog dice if you have one. Just make sure it has 6 sides, or if you are using a virtual dice, make sure you're rolling the 6-sided one.)
2. Open the [Airtable form](https://airtable.com/appxQkXtRynCqoXF6/pag2or3MimynyQiNO/form). In the form:
  * Fill out your name
  * Roll the die three times to determine your media type, file format and a surprise characteristic. For each die roll, fill out your result in the Airtable form.
3. Click the __Submit__ button to submit your form. Please only submit one form!

Your submissions will appear in a collaborative [Airtable gallery](https://airtable.com/appxQkXtRynCqoXF6/shrj6Ocn0opCRcjMa).

## Research a Solution; Update Airtable
_Imagine you are a digital archivist who has received the media type and file format with these particular characteristics.

Your task is to find at least __one online resource__ that describes how a particular institution might handle your particular media type, file format(s), and surprise characteristic (this might mean you have to find three separate resources, if you can't find one particular resource that addresses your particular scenario) in terms of __appraisal__ or __accessioning__ tasks.

An online resource can include a manual, a guide, a repository, a website, a slide deck, a YouTube tutorial, a white paper, a journal article, or really, anything!

Once you find a resource or two, update your gallery card in the [Airtable gallery](https://airtable.com/appxQkXtRynCqoXF6/shrj6Ocn0opCRcjMa).
