# Participation: 30 points

Participation is graded across three areas: 1.) pre-class reading reactions, 2.) in-class participation and discussion, and 3.) in-class/asynchronous activities.

## Pre-class reading reactions: 10 points
Each week, you will receive a set of readings and additional materials that require your review and response in the Brightspace "Discussions" section. Locate the topic titled "Week [#] - Pre-Class Reading Reactions" corresponding to the current week. It is essential to submit your weekly post by 3:30 PM on Wednesdays. Your response should encompass all the assigned readings and materials collectively. Ensure that your post includes the following three parts:

1. Aha! Share something new that you learned.
3. What? Mention something that you didn't fully understand.
4. More! Highlight a topic you would like to further discuss in class.

During our class sessions, we will allocate 10-15 minutes to discuss these reactions as a group.

Regarding grading, I will evaluate the completion and quality of your posts each week, focusing on content rather than your writing style.

## In-class discussions: 10 points
To fully engage in the course, it is expected that you come to class having completed all assigned readings and actively participate in classroom discussions and activities. For weeks when we have guest speakers or field trips, please come prepared with at least one question to ask the speaker.

If you are unable to attend class or need to participate remotely, please send an email to me by Wednesday 3:30 PM. You do not need to provide a detailed explanation or excuse, a simple "I cannot make class" will suffice. Although a Zoom link will be available on Brightspace for each class as an option, please note that class sessions are primarily conducted in-person by default.

## In-class activities: 10 points
Most weeks we will work on an in-class activity together as a group. The objective of these activities is to provide you with practical experience using the tools and processes employed in digital archiving and preservation. Activity instructions and supplementary files are kept in the [Activities folder](https://github.com/kiddmary/HIST-GA-1011/tree/main/Activities).

<p>If you are unable to complete the activity during class time, you will be responsible for completing it outside of class hours and submitting your results in Brightspace by the following Sunday. The format for submitting your results may vary each week, ranging from written documents, worksheets, spreadsheets, or something else.</p>

<p>While individual submission is expected, you are encouraged to work together and collaborate with your classmates.</p>
