Readings, lectures, discussions and in-class activities will shed light on the myriad challenges, best practices, risks/threats posed, and standards involved in successful digital preservation.</p>

<p>Through the course, students will develop the ability to design foundational workflows for digitizing and handling both analog and born-digital materials and effectively managing digital objects. Additionally, the course emphasizes the significance of institutional policy development and strategic planning, covering critical considerations such as preservation strategies, specialized preservation tools and techniques, technical skills, access protocols, and program sustainability.</p>

_This course fulfills the “Digital Credit“ requirement._

## Assignment Details

### Participation: 30 points

Participation is graded across three areas: 1.) pre-class reading reactions, 2.) in-class participation and discussion, and 3.) in-class/asynchronous activities.

#### Pre-class reading reactions: 10 points
Each week, you will receive a set of readings and additional materials that require your review and response in the Brightspace "Discussions" section. Locate the topic titled "Week [#] - Pre-Class Reading Reactions" corresponding to the current week. It is essential to submit your weekly post by 3:30 PM on Wednesdays. Your response should encompass all the assigned readings and materials collectively. Ensure that your post includes the following three parts:

1. Aha! Share something new that you learned.
3. What? Mention something that you didn't fully understand.
4. More! Highlight a topic you would like to further discuss in class.

During our class sessions, we will allocate 10-15 minutes to discuss these reactions as a group.

Regarding grading, I will evaluate the completion and quality of your posts each week, focusing on content rather than your writing style.

#### In-class discussions: 10 points
To fully engage in the course, it is expected that you come to class having completed all assigned readings and actively participate in classroom discussions and activities. For weeks when we have guest speakers or field trips, please come prepared with at least one question to ask the speaker.

If you are unable to attend class or need to participate remotely, please send an email to me by Wednesday 3:30 PM. You do not need to provide a detailed explanation or excuse, a simple "I cannot make class" will suffice. Although a Zoom link will be available on Brightspace for each class as an option, please note that class sessions are primarily conducted in-person by default.

#### In-class activities: 10 points
Most weeks we will work on an in-class activity together as a group. The objective of these activities is to provide you with practical experience using the tools and processes employed in digital archiving and preservation. Activity instructions and supplementary files are kept in the [Activities folder](https://github.com/kiddmary/HIST-GA-1011/tree/main/Activities).

<p>If you are unable to complete the activity during class time, you will be responsible for completing it outside of class hours and submitting your results in Brightspace by the following Sunday. The format for submitting your results may vary each week, ranging from written documents, worksheets, spreadsheets, or something else.</p>

<p>While individual submission is expected, you are encouraged to work together and collaborate with your classmates.</p>

<a name="assignments"></a>
## Assignments: 40 points
<p>All assignments are due by the beginning of class on the due date indicated in the syllabus. Please submit assignment documents through the Brightspace Assignments section.</p>

Assignment files and descriptions can be found in the [Assignments folder](https://github.com/kiddmary/HIST-GA-1011/tree/main/Assignments).

### Final Project: 30 points
Details about the Final Project can be found in the [Final Project Description document](/Assignments/final_project.md).

<a name="guidelines"></a>
## Guidelines and Expectations
* Students are expected to attend each weekly session for the full in-class time. Please email me as soon as you can to let me know you are unable to make a class, need to arrive late/leave early, or need to attend remotely.
* Assignments are due before class on the dates listed both on the syllabus, as well as within Brightspace. Assignments turned in after the due date will be penalized half a grade, unless you obtain advanced permission from me in writing.
* Class activities and assignments will mostly be worked on using class time. Any work that is not completed may be worked on and submitted by the end of the week through the course site.
* Extensions must be approved ahead of time in writing by the instructor.
* Papers should be in 12-point font, double-spaced, with 1-inch margins, and follow Chicago/Turabian style guide with numerated footnotes and bibliography
* At a few points over the semester, we will be utilizing specific programs or applications that you will need to download or otherwise access to perform in-class or asynchronous activities. Ahead of those weeks when installing a program is required, I will provide the necessary information for how to obtain them based on your operating system.
