# Abstract

## Overview

Your **abstract** serves as an early-stage check-in for your **Final Project paper and presentation**. It is an opportunity to begin defining the critical components of your final project and to ensure you have selected a suitable collection to work with.

Before writing your abstract, you must choose a collection from an existing institution that will serve as the foundation for your project. The collection must meet the following criteria:

- It is **described online** by an archival **finding aid**.
- It is **not yet digitized** (i.e., no digital surrogates are available online).
- It **contains materials beyond paper-based formats**, such as:
  - Email
  - Moving image materials
  - Born-digital materials
  - Datasets
  - Websites or social media archives

While not required, you are encouraged to schedule an on-site or virtual visit with your chosen repository, provided it is feasible for you and the archivist. This may help inform both your abstract and your final project approach.

## üí° **Extra Credit Opportunity**

You are encouraged to reach out to a repository and schedule a meeting (on-site or virtual) with an archivist or preservation/digital archives practitioner. This conversation can provide invaluable insights into your project and serve as a basis for real-world understanding of archival challenges and solutions.

### Guidelines for Extra Credit:
- To qualify, you must:
  - **Contact a repository** and arrange a meeting to discuss topics relevant to your project.
  - **Submit a summary** (minimum 300 words) reflecting on the discussion and its relevance to your final project.
- Up to **3 extra credit points** will be added to your Final Project score.

## üìù Abstract Submission Guidelines

Your abstract should be concise (1‚Äì2 sentences per checklist item is sufficient) and include the following details:

### üìå **General Details**
- [ ] **Chosen institution:**  
- [ ] **Institution type/size:**  
- [ ] **Estimated size of the archives department** (e.g., full-time, part-time, hourly staff):  
- [ ] **Research approach:** How will you gather details about your chosen institution and collection(s)?  

### üìÇ **Collection selection & digitization plan**
- [ ] **Collection(s) selected for digitization** *(include URL(s) to finding aid)*:  
- [ ] **Content overview:** Describe the intellectual content of your collection.  
- [ ] **Rationale:** Why is this collection a priority for processing and making materials accessible over others?  
- [ ] **Inventory:** Provide a basic physical inventory *(you may copy/paste form and extent details from the finding aid if applicable)*.  
- [ ] **Born-digital processing:** If the collection contains born-digital materials, what media does it contain, and what techniques will be required to transfer contents of the media?
- [ ] **Digitization requirements:** What types of digitization are needed based on physical formats present?  
- [ ] **Estimated duration:** How long do you anticipate the digitization process will take (rough estimate)?  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Constraints**
- [ ] What resource, budget, technological, or physical condition challenges might impact your digitization project?
- [ ] How does your institution currently provide access to digital collections? (Describe the platform(s) used, the level of access provided, the system(s) used for managing digital repository materials, front-end access, accessioning, appraisal, archival processing and arrangement, and any other function.)
- [ ] What are some limitations or challenges in the current setup? (Consider issues like usability, metadata quality, long-term storage, accessibility, rights and restrictions, or anything else.)
- [ ] How will you research other institutions or best practices to inform your proposal?

### üåç **Access & Discovery**
- [ ] **Intended users:** Who will benefit from this  collection being made available online?
- [ ] **Rights & restrictions:** Are there legal, ethical, or institutional barriers that could affect access?
- [ ] **Discovery methods:** How might users search for and locate specific materials, and also, see the relationship between search results and other components of the collection, or other related collections?
- [ ] **Access & usability:** How will users interact with and experience the works online? Think about the "path" the user might take from search, to results, to calling up the record(s). What does that look like?
