# File Format Report: 10 points
Due: February [Update me], 2024 (Week 4)<br>

<p>Write a 3-5 page paper exploring a sustainable or preservation-quality file format. Detail the formatâ€™s background and development (including if it is open source or proprietary), the extent of its use, and those features or affordances that make it more likely to remain functional/accessible over the long term. Use the Library of Congress Recommended Formats Statement as a jumping-off point: https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/RFS%202022-2023.pdf [update me]</p>
