# **üìÇ Store, Backup or Lose: The 3-2-1 Backup RPG**
*A Role-Playing Game About the Importance of Digital Preservation and Disaster Recovery*

## **üìú The Premise**
In this short role-playing game (RPG), you and your fellow classmates will take on the role of IT and digital archives professionals at various institutions. Your goal is to **ensure your institution‚Äôs data survives given various constraints.**

To do this, you‚Äôll rely on the **3-2-1 Backup Rule**:  
‚úÖ **3 copies of data**  
‚úÖ **2 different storage devices/types**  
‚úÖ **1 copy stored in a geographically-distinct location**

Following the theme of threes, the class will be divided into three teams/institutions. Each team should assign 1 "Driver" who will read the steps/narrative below to the group, 1 "Roller" who will roll the dice, and 1 "Recorder" who will record results and decisions made by the group.

## **üé≤ Step 1: Roll for your backup setup**
Designated Roller rolls **one six-sided die (1d6)** to determine their backup preparedness.

| **Roll** | **Backup Setup** |
|---------|----------------|
| **1** | **"One and Done"** ‚Äì Only one copy of your data |
| **2-3** | **"Two-for-Two"** ‚Äì Two copies, both in the same location |
| **4-6** | **"Three's the Charm"** ‚Äì Three copies, with at least one off-site |

## **üèõ Step 2: Roll for your institution type & holdings**
Roll **1d6** to determine what type of institution you are and how much data you need to protect.

| **Roll** | **Institution Type** | **Your Digital Holdings** |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **1** | **Small Museum Archive** | 5 TB of digitized rare photographs |
| **2** | **Public Library** | 50 TB of scanned microfilm |
| **3** | **Small Research Library** | 50 TB of faculty research, dissertations, and special collections |
| **4** | **Film Archive** | 5 PBs of scanned film reels |
| **5** | **National Archive** | 10 PB of government records and multimedia |
| **6** | **Historic Society** | 10 TB of born-digital local oral history audio recordings |

Encourage students to **imagine themselves as the IT lead or archivist** responsible for this collection!

## ** Step 3: Roll for your storage technology **

Roll **1d6** as many times as matches your backup setup (One and Done's would roll once; Two-for-Twos twice, and Three's-the-Charm thrice). If you roll the same technology twice, roll again so you have a unique list of technologies.

| **Roll** | **Disaster Type**     |
|----------|-----------------------|
| **1**    | Cloud Backup Platform |
| **2**    | On-site RAID          |
| **3**    | Off-site Isilon       |
| **4**    | Off-site NAS          |
| **5**    | Linear Tape Open Library |
| **6**    | Random box of unlabeled hard drives |

---

## **üî• Step 4: Major event**
Roll **1d6 again** to determine an event that befalls your institution.

| **Roll** | **Disaster Type** | **What Happens** |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1** | **Natural disaster** | Your repository suffers major flooding/leaks, affecting original media. |
| **2** | **Cyberattack** | Repository software goes offline; IT investigating potential cyberattack. |
| **3** | **Accidental backup corruption** | Your second copy was accidentally overwritten with corrupted data. |
| **4** | **Human error** | A staff member accidentally deletes preservation files. |
| **5** | **Hardware failure** | One of your devices fails randomly. |
| **6** | **Automation issue** | Preservation files accidentally saved at a low resolution. |

## **üçÄ Bonus Roll**
For those unlucky to have been doled the "One and Done" fate, please roll **1d6 again** to determine whether you get a bit lucky.

| **Roll** | **Stroke of luck** |
|---------|-----------------|
| **1-3** | Staff member actually kept a copy of materials on a random desktop: Add this to your backup setup. | 
| **4-6** | Better luck next time! |
