# **Archivematica Sandbox**

## **Introduction**

A **sandbox** environment allows users to experiment with an application without affecting live data. In this exercise, youâ€™ll use Archivematicaâ€™s sandbox to explore how digital archivists process and ingest Information Packages using a digital preservation system.

### **What is Archivematica?**
Archivematica is an open-source digital preservation system that automates tasks through **"microservices"** to streamline SIP transfers, ingestion, and the creation of Archival Information Packages (AIPs) and Dissemination Information Packages (DIPs).

### **Important Notes:**
- **The sandbox clears data daily around midnight**, so any session data, logs, or work in progress will be lost.  
- **If a job fails, donâ€™t worry**: note it and move on. Failed jobs wonâ€™t halt the entire process (this is the beauty of a microservice!)
- **You must run through the Tasks at least twice**. Please set aside **1-2 hours max** for this activity.

## **Steps to Take**

### **Open the Sandbox**
1. Open the **[Archivematica Website](https://www.archivematica.org/en/)** in a new browser tab.  
2. Click the **Demo** menu item.
3. In the **"Try our sandbox"** menu, click the **Launch** button.
4. Log in using these credentials:
   - **Username:** `demo@example.com`
   - **Password:** `demodemo`
   - If you see a **data breach warning**, click OK â€“ this is expected.

### **Open the Archivematica Documentation**
1. In another browser tab, open the **[Archivematica Website](https://www.archivematica.org/en/)** again.
2. Hover over the **Documentation** menu item and select the version labeled **"stable-current."**
3. Read through the **Getting Started** section to familiarize yourself with Archivematicaâ€™s user interface and workflow.
4. Open the **Archivematica Quick-Start Guide** (found under "Overview") and read the intro paragraph.

## **Perform the Tasks**

1. Complete **Tasks #1-#5** (skip step #0, and any other tasks/steps listed that are specific to setting up or using a Virtual Machine or VM).
2. During **Task #5**, there is a step that says: _"Review the different options and make changes as you like."_
   - ðŸ”§ **Along with adjusting the compression algorithm (as the guide suggests), I would like you to make one additional change.**
   - This change can be anything â€“ itâ€™s an opportunity to experiment with Archivematicaâ€™s settings.

3. After making your change, step through **Tasks #1-#4 again** (or at least far enough to see the effect of your adjustment).

## **Submit to Brightspace**

After completing the tasks, submit a **one-paragraph reflection** addressing:  
- **Were any Archivematica steps confusing?** If so, explain why.
- **Did any jobs fail?** If yes, which ones, and any guess why?
- **What additional setting/step did you adjust?**
  - Describe the change, whether it worked, and any issues you encountered.
  - *(Optional)* Include screenshots of any errors or successes.

## **Come Prepared to Discuss Your Adjustment**  

In class, we will go around the room, and each student will have **3-5 minutes** to discuss:  
- The **adjustment** they made in **Task #5**
- The **results** they observed when running through Tasks 1-4 again.

No need to prepare slides. This will be an informal discussion.
