# Short Stack 🥞

## Overview

In this activity, you will review documentation from Yale University Library to identify and describe a **“short stack”**: a small group of digital systems that are interoperable with one another.

Similar to the Bentley example discussed in class, Yale uses multiple systems that work together to support the intake, stewardship, delivery, and discovery of digital collections. Rather than trying to understand Yale’s entire systems ecosystem at once, this activity asks you to focus narrowly on one small, concrete integration.

The goal of this assignment is to help you better understand:
- the range of digital repository systems in use today
- how those systems are implemented in real institutional settings
- how systems interact to support the digital stewardship lifecycle

## Step 1: Review documentation and resources

Review the following documentation to identify possible system integrations at Yale:

- [Informative diagram shared during my first week at Yale](https://github.com/digital-archives/HISTGA1011/blob/main/slides/img/week_04_yale_diagram.png)  
- [Slide deck by the Director of Digital Special Collections and Access](https://www.iaml.info/sites/default/files/pdf/manton_prioritizing_preservation_through_access_iaml2024.pdf)  
- [Born Digital @ Yale LibGuide](https://guides.library.yale.edu/c.php?g=300384&p=3593184)  
- [“Before and After: Digital Media Accessioning Service”](https://campuspress.yale.edu/borndigital/2024/06/03/before-and-after-digital-media-accessioning-service/) (blog post by Alice Prael)

You do **not** need to read every document closely. Skim with the following questions in mind:

- What systems are mentioned?
- Where do those systems appear to exchange data or depend on one another?

## Step 2: Describe a short stack

Choose **one short stack** that includes:
- at least two systems
- no more than three systems
- one to three points of integration

This constraint is intentional. As we saw in class with the Bentley example, even a three-system integration can become complex very quickly.

### Your write-up should include:

### 1. System identification
List each system in your short stack by name.

### 2. System functions
Using the list of digital repository functions discussed in class, identify **at least one function** that each system in your stack performs.

> Note: A single system may cover more than one function. That is normal and expected.

### 3. Integration purpose
Describe the purpose of the integration between the systems.

- What information is being shared between systems?
- Why does one system need access to another system’s data?
- What problem does this integration help solve?

If the documentation does not explicitly explain the purpose of an integration, make a reasonable guess based on what you learned in class.

Think back to the Bentley example, where integrations helped to reduce duplicate data entry, connect descriptive records with preserved digital files, support access and discovery and maintain relationships between systems.
