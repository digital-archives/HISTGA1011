# Grading - Points Breakdown

## Participation:

|------------------------|--------|
| Discussion Lead        | 20     |
| Weekly activities      | 30     |
| **Total**              | **50** |


## Final Project:

| Item                              | Points |
|-----------------------------------|--------|
