# Accessioning

## Definition
# Accessioning

"Accessioning is ... the suite of activities through which archivists appraise, transfer, stabilize, and document archival acquisitions. Accessioning provides pathways to access, informs future decisions, and promotes sustained resource commitment for the care of archival materials."

Archival Accessioning Best Practices (2024)

## Definition
# Born-digital item

__Born-digital__ items are materials that are created in a digital format. This includes websites, email, digital photographs, electronic records, and more. Born-digital items are distinct from analog items that are subsequently digitized, such as paper manuscripts or photographs.

## Definition
# Appraisal - 1/2

In an archival context, __appraisal__ is the process of determining whether records and other materials have permanent (archival) value. Appraisal may be done at the collection, creator, series, file, or item level. Appraisal can take place prior to donation and prior to physical transfer, at or after accessioning. The basis of appraisal decisions may include a number of factors, including the recordsâ€™ provenance and content, their authenticity and reliability, their order and completeness, their condition and costs to preserve them, and their intrinsic value. Appraisal often takes place within a larger institutional collecting policy and mission statement.

## Definition
# Appraisal - 2/2

"Accessioning is the process of transferring and documenting the transfer of collections material into the Libraries' care. For __born-digital materials__, that means safely copying them into the Libraries' temporary storage system and documentating the process. Digital files should be accessioned within four months of receipt."

# Determine What You Have: A Two-Step Identification Process
1. Physical Appraisal: What media am I working with?
2. Technical Appraisal: What file format(s) am I dealing with?

---

## Definition
# File Format

A __file format__ defines the way information is encoded and structured within a file. It determines how data is stored, organized, and read by software or systems.

<!--presenter notes

When we are working with media containing files, it is very likely that we will encounter files at scale. For example, we may receive a pile of floppy disks, each containing 20 files. So, maybe it might be easy enough to just manually identify each file manually.

But what if an archivist is handling an entire harddrive, containing hundreds or even thousands of files. Performing a technical appraisal at this scale is simply impossible to do manually.

On screen is an image of ExifTool, which can be used to extract so-called "technical metadata" from a file or group of files.

## Definition
# Technical Metadata

__Technical Metadata__ refers to data that describes technical characteristics of a file, such as the file format, file size, provenance (i.e. creation date, last modified date), and other details.

---

## Tool
# File Information Tool Set (FITS)

Developed by Harvard University, the File Information Tool Set (FITS) is a suite of tools (including ExifTool) that, together, may be used to identify and extract technical metadata from files. The data is output into XML format.

# Question: Why might a repository need to identify the file formats present in a specific accession? What practical purposes or benefits could this serve for managing and preserving the collection?
