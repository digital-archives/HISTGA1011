# Final Project

## Overview

Utilizing the tools and information we have discussed over the semester, you will propose a **digitization/transfer and access plan** for undigitized or inaccessible materials.

During the final class, you will present your plan to the class. Presentations are expected to be accompanied by a slide deck, followed by a question-and-answer session afterward. Part of the presentation grade will include asking questions and/or providing feedback during Q&As for other presentations.

An **abstract scoping** of your project will be due mid-way through the semester (see the <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/schedule/" target="_blank">class schedule</a>).

## üìå SCENARIO

_You are an archivist working in the special collections department of [organization/institution of your choice]. As part of an initiative to enhance digital access, you have identified one or more collections in the institution‚Äôs finding aids that contain **undigitized or currently inaccessible materials** such as analog media, obsolete digital formats, or physical documents without existing digital surrogates._

_Recognizing your expertise and knowledge in digital preservation workflow management, the Director of Special Collections has appointed you project lead. Your task is to develop a comprehensive **Digitization Project Plan** that outlines how these materials will be selected, digitized or transferred, preserved, and made accessible** to library users._

_This project requires you to "start from scratch", meaning you must choose materials that **are not already digitized or available online**. This ensures that you will critically analyze the challenges involved in digital preservation, including selection criteria, technical workflows, metadata creation, and access strategies._

### ‚≠ê Important Selection Criteria:
- **Your chosen collection must include materials beyond standard paper-based formats.**  
- While you may include some flat materials (e.g., photographs, maps, manuscripts), **your project cannot focus exclusively on paper-based materials requiring only scanning or photography.**  
- Your project must engage with at least **one other format**, such as:
  - **Magnetic media** (e.g., audiotapes, videotapes, floppy disks, hard drives)
  - **Optical media** (e.g., CDs, DVDs)
  - **Born-digital files** requiring file format migration

_Your final report and presentation will advocate for why this digitization project is important, how it aligns with institutional priorities, and what resources are needed to make it successful. The goal is to persuade senior leadership to fund and support your proposal while demonstrating the value of digital preservation to the broader organization._

## The Paper

Writing this report is an opportunity for you to **think through a complete digital preservation project** and identify and articulate what people, tools, and other resources are needed to put a digital preservation plan into action.

Presenting your findings provides an opportunity for you to **practice discussing a project at a high level** that speaks to a broad audience and answer questions about your decision-making process.

Overall, I want to see that you can take the concepts and information we have discussed over the semester and apply them to your own vision for a digital preservation program, that thinks through both the long-term preservation and access of data objects.

## The Presentation

**Length:** 15 minutes (10-minute presentation followed by a 5-minute Q&A session)

Your presentation should be an **overview of your proposed project**, highlighting key information, features, and challenges.

You are proposing this project for consideration to the class and professor, who will serve as a **digital preservation project proposal panel**. Following the presentation, the panel will ask follow-up questions to learn more about your project and decisions. This is an opportunity to **practice discussing your rationale and decisions** based on the project you put together.

When serving as a panel member, **ask thoughtful questions** to learn more about the project being presented and how the presenter will handle aspects of the project that may not have come up during their presentation.
