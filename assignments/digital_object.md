# Lightning Talk: Digital Object

## Assignment Overview

For this assignment, you will choose a digital object and conduct an in-depth analysis of its background, development, and usage. Your goal is to explore and describe the "layers of complexity" involved in making the object accessible and understandable, both to humans and machines. **You will present your findings to the class as a 5-minute lightning talk, that addresses this question: "In 100 years, when this digital object has been rendered obsolete, what will a future archivist need to extract and preserve the information it contains?"**

By "layers of complexity," I am referring to the various components—hardware, software, specialized knowledge, and materials—required to render the object and its information readable and usable. This could include understanding the file formats, the software needed to open and interact with it, or even the specific hardware or emulation environments necessary to maintain access over time.

## Assignment Details
 
**Due Date:** Week 4

### Suggested Lightning Talk Structure

* __Background__ (1 min): Briefly introduce the digital object. What is its purpose and how is it typically used? Why did you choose to investigate this particular object?
* __Development__* (1 min): Outline the historical and technical development of the digital object. What key technologies or standards influence how it works today?
* __Layers of Complexity__ (3 min): Dive into the details of what is required to access, view, and preserve this object, focusing on:
  - Hardware: Any physical devices necessary (e.g., specific machines, peripherals, storage media)
  - Software: Programs or applications needed to render the object
  - Specialized Knowledge: Skills or knowledge required to interpret, use, or preserve the object
  - Material Requirements: Any additional dependencies or components critical to accessing or maintaining the object (e.g., file formats, metadata)
