**SCENARIO:** Your Archives Department at Harvard University is collaborating on a grant for a digitization project. Your task is to develop a high-level digitization plan for two collections, each managed by two teams (Group A and Group B). Your group will create a detailed report and inventory, including cost and production time estimates, and documentation of proposed schemas/standards. The collections mainly consist of paper, photographic and other 2D materials, with some exceptions.

## Step 1: Pre-Imaging Review {#step-1}

**Prepare and share documents:**¬†
- One group member should open the shared <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e2OQoWaPbySWqyH2w8qbA95oBJB4BCKE?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Imaging and Conservation Activity - Templates</a> folder and make local copies of the following:
  1. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ipJfplMvKjXaupTq8RHEfGvyS1h2pzOlvrU2jtRfZ7w/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Template - Imaging Review - Report</a>
  2. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dEc1DEEJxvIa5UAxx6bgXsr3JC02RTxMh8xhcjg-Qes/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Template - Imaging Review - Inventory</a>
- Share editing permissions with all group members.

*üìå Important: The Inventory spreadsheet has two tabs, one for each group's collection. To avoid confusion, delete the  tab that does not belong to your group.*

**Discuss key aspects with your group (5-10 minutes):**
- **Material types**: What types of materials are in the collection?
- **Digitization equipment**: What devices might be needed to capture each material type?
- **Condition**: Use the spreadsheet to flag any materials that require conservation assessment.
- **Approach**:
  - Should all recto and verso pages be digitized, including blank pages?
  - Should multi-page documents be scanned as double or single-page spreads?
  - What order should book covers/spines be digitized?
  - Are there any materials that should **not** be digitized at this time?
  - What is your folder-naming schema? What convention will each capture file within each folder follow?
- **Outstanding questions**: What clarifications do you need from me?

## Step 2: Consultation {#step-2}
Once your group has completed the review, let me know, and I will consult you on your digitization approach, and answer any other project-related questions.

## Step 3: Complete Report and Inventory {#step-3}

### Inventory Spreadsheet Guidance {#inventory}
#### **Pre-populated fields (do not edit)**
- **Series:** Name of the finding aid series.
- **Box number & folder number:** Since this is a folder-level list, for each folder, the box numbers may repeat themselves (e.g., the same box can contain multiple folders).
- **Content estimate count & format:** Estimated material type count of items.
- **Restrictions:** Access restriction statement.
- **Condition:** Any noted conservation issues.

#### **Fields to be completed by group (highlighted in yellow)**
- **HLIS Service Category:** Identify the appropriate <a href="https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/DigitalImaging/Imaging+Services+Project+Services+Categories" target="_blank">Harvard Library Imaging Services Category (HLIS)</a> for each folder (e.g., B01).
- **Folder Name:** Enter the folder‚Äôs name based on the folder-naming schema described in the Group Report.
- **DLF Capture Device**: Using the [Harvard Category to DLF Mapping Table](#hlis-dlf-map) below, identify and list the _DLF Cost Calculator Capture Device_ that corresponds to the folder‚Äôs HLIS Service Category. 
- **Capture Count:** Estimate the number of captures (e.g., scans, photographs) taken per folder. _Take into consideration the group's capture decisions, such as whether you will be digitizing blank pages, etc._
- **Imaging Time (Minutes):** Use the <a href="https://dashboard.diglib.org/">DLF Digitization Cost Calculator</a> to estimate the imaging time. Rather than filling out a Cost Calculator form for each folder (which would be extremely time-consuming), my suggestion is to first, identify all folders that use the same DLF Capture Device, complete a Cost Calculator form per Device, and distribute the estimated time proportionally among the folders (feel free to use your own approach!). **Guidance on filling out the DLF Digitization Cost Calculator form:**
  - **Number of scans**: Enter the Capture Count subtotal for each HLIS Category/Device. If a folder contains materials from multiple categories, calculate each separately and add them up them later.
  - **Staffing**: Enter the following details:
    - Name: Enter the staff role (e.g., "Digitization Technician").
    - Type: Select "Hourly" or "Salaried".
    - Rate: Provide a reasonable rate or salary.
    - Benefits: Enter 20%.
  - **Capture Device**: Select the DLF Capture Device listed in the Inventory.
  - **Preparation of Original Material**: (_Ensure you select the staff performing each task._)
    - Condition review: Enter 100.
    - Fastener removal, Sorting material into items, Rights review: Leave blank.
  - **Quality Control**: (_Ensure you select the staff performing each task._)
    - Level: Select Level 1.
    - Percentage of Material: Enter 10%.
  - **Post Processing, Post Preparation, Other**: Leave blank.
  - **Metadata**:
    - Level: Select Level 3.
    - Percentage of Material: Enter 32%.
  - Click ‚ÄúSave and Continue‚Äù; this will output an estimated time in minutes. Record this in your Inventory under Imaging Time (Minutes).
- **Output File Type(s):** Identify the resulting preservation file types for the digitized material using the [Library of Congress Recommended Formats](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/TOC.html) as your guide.
- **Resolution:** Express in DPI (dots per inch). General recommendations:
  - 300 DPI: optimal for most material (good balance between detail capture and file size).
  - 400 DPI: more detailed capture, consider for photography.
  - 600 DPI: small items, a lot of detail.
- **OCR (Y/N):** Indicate whether optical character recognition (OCR) is needed.
- **Cost:** Calculate the digitization cost per folder using the pricing guide listed beneath each <a href="https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/DigitalImaging/Imaging+Services+Project+Services+Categories" target="_blank">HLIS Project Service Category</a>.

### Group Report Guidance {#report}

- **Group Name (A or B) & Members**
- **Collection Name**
- **Scope Summary:** Overview of materials to be digitized.
- **Workflow:** Provide step-by-step instructions for scanning/photographing.
- **Selection Criteria:** Rationale for what is/not being digitized.
- **Folder- & File-naming Schema:** Describe naming convention for each folder and capture.
- **Staff Roles:** Identify various staff roles necessary to complete the work.

- **Estimated Capture Count and Imaging Time Total:** Grand total from the Inventory spreadsheet.
- **Estimated Cost and Production Length:** Project total cost and duration.
- **Group Notes/Decisions:** Documentation of overarching digitization approach decisions made by the group.

_\* This equivalency chart is for the purposes of this assignment only. If you are unsure what DLF Device to go with, you may default to ‚ÄúManual DSLR‚Äù._

## Step 4: Submit Your Inventory and Group Report to Brightspace {#step-4}
Each group member must submit both an export of the Inventory and Report to Brightspace.

The assignment is due by end of day Tuesday next week to allow time for group collaboration outside of class.
