# Final Project Presentation

## Overview  

During the final class, you will present your digitization project plan to your classmates and professor. This presentation is an opportunity to share your project’s goals, challenges, and proposed solutions while receiving feedback on your approach.  

Your presentation should first describe how your chosen institution currently handles digital preservation and access. Then, highlight key limitations or challenges and propose improvements based on research into best practices at other institutions.

Please also touch on:
- The collection you selected and why  
- Your strategy in terms of getting your collection into the preservation repository, and providing access to it
- Key technical, logistical, or ethical challenges  

Presentations will be followed by a Q&A session, where classmates and faculty will ask questions about your decisions and workflow.
