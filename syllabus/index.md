* Students are expected to attend each weekly session for the full in-class time. Please email me as soon as you can to let me know you are unable to make a class, need to arrive late/leave early, or need to attend remotely.
* Assignments are due before class on the dates listed both on the syllabus, as well as within Brightspace. Assignments turned in after the due date will be penalized half a grade, unless you obtain advanced permission from me in writing.

* Extensions must be approved ahead of time in writing by the instructor.
* Papers should be in 12-point font, double-spaced, with 1-inch margins, and follow Chicago/Turabian style guide with numerated footnotes and bibliography
* At a few points over the semester, we will be utilizing specific programs or applications that you will need to download or otherwise access to perform in-class or asynchronous activities. Ahead of those weeks when installing a program is required, I will provide the necessary information for how to obtain them based on your operating system.
