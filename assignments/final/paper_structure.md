**Paper structure and requirements (Due [Update me])**

### General requirements

**Length:** 10-12 pages (not including required appendices and bibliography)

The paper should reference relevant readings and resources we have discussed over the course of the semester. Make sure to use appropriate in-text citations and include a bibliography. Visuals are welcome and often necessary: include them in your appendices or within the text of the paper (graphics do not count toward your paper length).

The collection you choose should be, at minimum, 5 linear feet and include at minimum three of the format types we have discussed over the semester.

### Structure

#### Introduction

This can also be thought of as your “elevator pitch”. Incorporate a brief, high-level overview of the problem you are trying to solve, what qualifies your department to address the problem, how you will go about solving the problem, and the resulting outcomes.

#### Rationale

Describe why your department is choosing this particular collection or collections for digitization over other undigitized collections in the repository. Here, you might address:

- Long-term benefits to or potential impacts on research, education, artistry, teaching, public programming, social movements, surfacing deliberately marginalized histories, or advancing yours or the field at-large’s technical capacity
- Current circulation statistics for the physical collection, and how digitization and access may stand to increase usage and physical or virtual engagement
- Physical fragility of materials, where a digital surrogate may reduce cumulative damage or exposure through physical handling or use
- Increasing compliance to national and/or local preservation standards
- Alignment with your department or institution’s overall goals and objectives

#### Stakeholders

List staff and/or departments who have a stake in the success of your Plan. For each, specifically call out their role and responsibility for each step of your workflow, and/or in your overall Plan’s goals for outcomes or long-term sustainability.

#### Scope/inventory

Provide a high-level summarization of the candidate collection(s)’s form and extent. An item-level inventory is not required, but feel free to link out to a more detailed finding aid or other catalog record if available.

You should also make an effort to describe what may be out of scope for this project. For example, your collection may include a group of commercial recordings that do not carry the same risks as other unique/rarer items in the collection requiring digitization.

#### Selection criteria and prioritization approach

Describe the order in which materials will be digitized based on a selection criteria that takes into consideration the materials’ format, condition, copyright restrictions, or dependencies on specific resources, hardware, or software, or other factors.

#### Preservation approach

Describe how your project will be carried out from start to finish. Where possible, cite appropriate national standards and accepted professional practices. If your project’s methodology departs from usual standards and procedures, explain why its goals require such an approach and how the results would be interoperable with other relevant resources that do follow existing standards.

#### End-to-end workflow

Describe your proposed workflow for digitization that addresses these stages:

- Acquisition/accessioning
- Archival processing, appraisal, and description
- Preparation of works for digitization by in-house staff, vendors, or both
- Digital repository
- Submission
- Ingest/file storage
- Any other processing steps (for example, optical character recognition, auto-transcription, file normalization, quality control, rights clearances)
- Long-term digital preservation activities: Backups, data integrity/other audits, disaster planning/risk mitigation, and other measures taken to ensure digitized works persist over the long term

#### Discovery, access and use

For each stage in your workflow, clarify:

- Who/which staff will perform each step
- Which software and hardware are required to handle each step
- How each step progresses from one stage to the next. Are there any hand-offs between staff or systems? If so, describe what those are and how they prompt the next step or stage in the process.

Your workflow narrative will be supported by the Workflow diagram included in your appendix, so make sure your workflow narrative and diagram accurately reflect one another.

#### Technical specifications and standards

- Software/hardware: Name any software applications or other tools/systems used throughout your workflow, as well as related hardware that will be used to automate or facilitate certain processes.
- File naming schema: how files/folders be named
- File formats: Determine the submission, preservation, and distribution formats your digital repository will accept or produce for each material type identified in your inventory.
- File resolution: Describe minimum file resolutions/sample rates for each of your file formats
- Quality control (QC): Determine how resulting digitized files are checked for quality
- Metadata: Identify which schemas you will use for descriptive, administrative, preservation, technical metadata, and access/catalog metadata
- Access
- Rights

Identify any potential intellectual property or privacy issues that might affect access to this material. If the material you have selected includes rights issues that could preclude access, this is okay and normal, and a good opportunity for you to discuss why this is and how this may affect certain aspects of your workflow.

#### Front-end experience/user personas

Describe who your end users are, and what they might require to both discover and access your digitized collection. What are their characteristics? What are their needs, and what features can support how they might best discover and experience these materials?

Keep in mind that some of these proposed features may be format-specific: digitized audio will require a different end-user interface and features that are vastly different than digitized photographs, for example. Use your scope/inventory to inform how you describe various end-user experiences.

You will support your end-user narrative by creating a End-user experience mockup in your Appendix.

#### Challenges

Describe anticipated challenges or obstacles that may hinder your Plan’s success, and how you might meet them. These challenges may stem from:

- Issues related to the materials to be digitized
- Workflow gaps
- Policy gaps
- Available budget or resources for both short- and long-term digital preservation efforts
- Technical shortcomings
- Sustainability

Describe the plan for the long-term preservation of your project. This may include identifying:

- Institutional commitments that may be required to sustain storage, integrity and access of digitized contents over the long term.
- Specifics over how and where your preservation masters will be stored and any additional details on digital preservation infrastructures.
- Any existing institutional policies that sustainable digital collections management (if there are no existing policies to cite, this would be a good time to point that out).

**Appendices**

- End-user experience mockup: To support your Front-end experience/user personas narrative, create a mockup that describes how a user will search, browse, and eventually come to a single record in your digitized collection. Use this mockup to point out key features and functionality provided by your access portal. You should also think critically about how users might drill down into various representation hierarchies. For example, a digitized book may contain multiple scanned pages. How will the user understand each pages’ relation to one another? What about digitized audio, where sometimes content is contained on a Side A vs a Side B: how will the user understand each track’s relationship to one another?

- Workflow diagram To support your End-to-end workflow narrative, create/devise a workflow diagram that identifies various stages, individual processes, stakeholders, hard/software, decision points, and termination/loop points. We will discuss in class available tools and review examples that will be helpful for you when creating your own diagram, but note that if you wish, you can draw/sketch this out by hand or use a program like Google Slides or Draw.
