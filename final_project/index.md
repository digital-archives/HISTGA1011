# Final Project

## Overview

For your final project, you will develop a **Digitization and Access Plan** (hereafter the "Plan") for a group of materials that are not currently available onlineâ€”even though these materials may be accessible in person (e.g., in a reading room). This project will consist of a written <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/final_project/paper_structure" target="_blank">paper</a> and an accompanying <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/final_project/presentation" target="_blank">presentation</a>, which you will deliver on the last day of class.

To guide your progress, you will submit an <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/final_project/abstract" target="_blank">abstract</a> mid-way through the semester as a check-in to ensure you have identified a suitable group of materials to work with, and are on track with your project. 

See the <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/schedule/" target="_blank">class schedule</a> for due date details.

## Scenario

_You are an archivist working in the special collections department of [organization/institution of your choosing]. As part of an initiative to enhance digital access to the institution's archives, your department has identified a candidate collection containing **records that are currently inaccessible to users online** that they wish to make available._

_Recognizing your expertise in digital archives workflow management, the Director of Special Collections has appointed you as **Project Lead**. Your task is to analyze how your institution currently handles digital access and preservation, write out a plan describing how these selected materials will be made accessible online, and present this plan to the Special Collections Committee._

## ðŸ“Œ Selection Criteria

To ensure a well-rounded project, your candidate collection records must meet the following criteria:

- **Existing online finding aid:** Your chosen collection must be documented in an established online archival finding aid.
- **Materials not currently available online:** Although the collection is held by an institution and described in an online finding aid, the materials themselves must not have been made accessible through a digital library or collection website. You will need to verify this by browsing available finding aids and confirming that the materials remain unavailable.
- **Selection scope:** You are not required to propose a plan for every component of a finding aid. Instead, focus on a deliberate selection of materials (e.g., one series, or one specific type of format, or one intellectual grouping) to develop your plan.
- **Diverse media:** While inclusion of some flat materials (e.g., photographs, maps, manuscripts) is acceptable, your project cannot focus exclusively on paper-based items that only require scanning or photography. Your project must incorporate at least one non-paper-based format, such as:
  - **Magnetic recorded media** (e.g., audiotapes, videotapes, floppy disks, entire hard drives)
  - **Optical Media** (e.g., CDs, DVDs)
  - **Born-digital records** requiring file format migration or emulation (e.g., software, video games, database records, research datasets)

## Project Goals

Your final paper and presentation should:
- **Demonstrate the significance** of the materials you selected and why they should be prioritized for access.
- **Articulate the technical, labor, and logistical considerations** involved in not only getting the materials online, but also promoting their discovery and access.
- **Explain how the project aligns with institutional priorities** and contributes to broader digital preservation and archiving efforts.

This project is an opportunity to apply digital archiving and preservation principles in a real-world context, critically engage with selection and access strategies, and develop skills in planning and advocacy within archival institutions.
