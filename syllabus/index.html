<p>Digital Archives explores the major stages of the digital curation life-cycle, and delves into the complexities surrounding the creation, appraisal, acquisition, processing/description, storage, digitization/reformatting, and making accessible, archives of all formats. Readings, lectures, discussions and in-class activities will shed light on the myriad challenges, best practices, risks/threats posed, and standards involved in successful digital preservation.</p>

<p>Through the course, students will develop the ability to design foundational workflows for digitizing and handling both analog and born-digital materials and effectively managing digital objects. Additionally, the course emphasizes the significance of specialized preservation tools and techniques, including understanding essential technical skills.</p>

<p><em>This course fulfills the “Digital Credit“ requirement.</em></p>
