## Definition
# Archival Repository

An archival **repository** describes a physical location where an archive stores the physical holdings of their collection. Ideally, this is a secure and stable environment to combat against risk of damage from threats like water, heat and pests over the long-term both in service of preservation and access/retrieval.

<!--presenter notes 

Let‚Äôs start with a definition we are all probably fairly familiar with at this point: archival repository. An archival repository is a physical place where archives are kept. The physical components of an archival repository are stored on shelves (aka ‚Äústacks‚Äù) in, ideally, highly monitored, climate-controlled spaces, to ensure the materials are protected from risks posed by things like rodents, bugs, and humidity, but also organized in a way so items can be retrieved for access or remediation.

-->

<div class="quote">
‚ÄúA <b>digital repository</b> is like the electronic equivalent of the library stacks; digital items are organized and searchable there, and they have a specific, persistent location so repository managers maintain intellectual control and researchers can find what they‚Äôre looking for. A digital repository does more than simply house digital objects online, it preserves their integrity in the long term.‚Äù
</div>

<!--presenter notes 

Link to Rachael‚Äôs blog post: https://www.tdl.org/2019/04/what-is-a-digital-repository/

Digital repositories function much in the same way as a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù archival repository.

The way digital repositories are set up, managed and maintained in many ways are analogous to how physical stacks work, and why they are set up in the way they are set up. That said, a digital repository also has its differences. The main difference is in the way the things in the repository are managed. In archival repositories, you use rooms and shelves. In digital repositories, you use systems and databases, along with hardware, not just to store items securely, but manage them through their entire lifecycle across various digital preservation functions, such as ingest, access, and description.

<a href="https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Tools_Grid" target="_blank">COPTR Tools Grid</a>

<!--presenter notes

If you want to take a deep dive into all the systems that are out there, there are a couple of resources to check out. The first one is a crowd-sourced Google Sheet,
‚ÄúThe Collection Management System Collection‚Äù, which was kick-started by Ashley Blewer, a preeminent software developer, educator, writer, and artist who has done
incredible work, especially within the field of audio/visual and moving image preservation. In 2017, she made this spreadsheet publicly available for folks in the
field to contribute system descriptions in a matrix form.

Another helpful resource is the Community Owned Digital Preservation Tool Registry (COPTR) Tools Grid, which uses a Wiki format. This grid starts off with a matrix of
general digital preservation object types like ‚Äúaudio‚Äù or ‚Äúebook‚Äù on the Y-axis, and broad digital preservation functional areas on the X-axis. You can click on any of the numbers to see a list of relevant tools for that object type/functional area, and further drill down into other functional area sub-categories. There are nearly 600 tools described in this Wiki.

# Integrating Systems
## How to Knit Software Systems Together

<img src="img/week_04_knit.gif">

<!--presenter notes

Image from GIF Cities (https://web.archive.org/web/20091027084349/http://hk.geocities.com/kieou/3.htm)

In the early days of digital archiving and preservation, a variety of platforms emerged, to better automate, standardize and streamline various processes. Systems like ArchivesSpace emerged, designed with the intention of enabling archivists to accession collections, describe them accurately, and create and publish finding aids. Yet, these systems were built in isolation, tailored to specific tasks without consideration for the full lifecycle of digital records.

-->

---

# Question
## Why might one digital archives system need to communicate with another?

<!--presenter notes

Let‚Äôs imagine that the institution we work at have selected, from a collection, a set hand-written letters for digitization.

The process begins with recording the accession event in ArchivesSpace, then describing the letters to eventually be published as a finding aid.

Let's say, parallel to the archivist processing the letters, the acquiring curator expresses that they wish for the letters to be made available digitally, so that researchers can search the text.

The letters are sent to the photography lab, where each letter is scanned and color corrected, followed by careful renaming and organization into folders. These files were then transferred to a digital asset
management system for curation, and separately, submitted to a digital repository for long-term preservation. Each step in this example different systems, operating independently of one another. The result? A manual, time-consuming effort to link the
digital representations back to their descriptions in ArchivesSpace.

-->

---

## Scenario: Digitizing Handwritten Letters
Imagine an institution selects a set of handwritten letters for digitization. The process unfolds like this:

1Ô∏è. **Description:** The letters are accessioned and described in ASpace.
2. **Digitization Request:** A curator requests that the letters be digitized so researchers can search the text.
3. **Scanning & Processing:** Letters are scanned.
4. **Storage & Preservation:** Digital files are transferred separately to digital repository for long-term storage.
5Ô∏è. **Manual Linking:** ASpace links to photographs manually updated.

---

# Challenges of Disconnected Systems
‚ùå High Risk of Human Error: Manual updates encourage mistakes.
‚ùå Difficult Maintenance: If one system updates, it may break connections with others.
‚ùå Redundant Data Entry: The same information (e.g., box number) is entered multiple times across systems.
‚ùå Inconsistent & Fragmented Metadata: Metadata stored in different systems may not align, reducing discoverability.

# Systems Integration

<br>
<div class="quote">"A functional coupling between software applications to act as a coordinated whole."</div>

<div class="author">Max Eckard</div>
<div class="work">Making Your Tools Work for You</div>

<!--presenter notes

Systems integration describes ‚Äú[a] functional coupling between software applications to act as a coordinated whole.‚Äù This quote comes from Max Eckard‚Äôs book *Making Your Tools Work for You*, which was originally ‚Äúadopted from... the ArchivesSpace Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) Integrations sub-team, which goes on to state that ‚Äòa defining characteristic of all integrations is communication, i.e., seamless data flow‚Äìwithout a manual, intermediary step‚Äìbetween systems‚Äù (4).

Integration characterizes the ability of one or multiple systems to ‚Äútalk‚Äù to one another. The development of interoperable standards and the adoption of holistic digital asset management solutions have started to bridge the gaps between previously isolated systems. These integrated platforms streamline the archival process‚Äîfrom digitization to online accessibility‚Äîreducing redundancy, minimizing errors, and significantly improving the discoverability of digital archives.

In addition, integration allows you to maintain your current system ‚Äúecosystem,‚Äù which is advantageous because no single system can do everything. In fact, having a single all-encompassing system might not be ideal. This modular approach enables systems ecosystems to be more flexible and adaptable over time.

## Case Study
# Bentley Historical Library

Archivematica-ArchivesSpace-Dspace Integration

<!--presenter notes

In this week‚Äôs assigned reading, we learned how the Bentley Historical Library developed an integrated system using three of the four digital repository system types we just covered: **Digital Preservation System** (Archivematica), **Institutional Repository** (DSpace), and **Content Management System** (ArchivesSpace). The goal was to leverage each system‚Äôs strengths to fully support an ‚Äúend-to-end digital archives workflow.‚Äù  

These types of integrative setups are quite common in digital archives. Such integrations are achieved using **application programming interfaces (APIs)**, which are essentially sets of instructions or protocols that allow one system to communicate with or update data in another.  

Let‚Äôs explore each of these systems further.

# Software as a Service (SaaS)

__Software as a Service (SaaS)__ refers to any system that provides its services via the cloud. Rather than having to download software on your computer, you can access this software using a web browser. The software and all its data are hosted and maintained on remote servers by a third-party provider.

<!--presenter notes

A popular archives-specific example of a SaaS platforms are Archivematica, ArchivesSpace. A SaaS service you might be Google Drive, Zoom.

There are a lot of benefits to using a SaaS system. 
1. Users can access SaaS applications through a web browser, from any device with an internet connection.
2. Maintenance-Free: The service provider manages updates, patches, and security, so users don't need to worry about maintenance.
3. Scalability: Users can scale up or down based on their needs, adjusting usage or subscription plans easily.

SaaS eliminates the need for users to install, manage, and maintain software, making it a convenient and cost-effective solution for many businesses and individuals.

-->

# Open source

**Open source** refers to software whose source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, modify, distribute, and use it. The key idea behind open-source software is that it promotes collaboration and transparency, enabling developers and users to contribute to its improvement, adapt it to their needs, and share it freely.

# Microservice

A **microservice** is an application responsible for performing a single function.

<!--presenter notes

A microservice is an application designed to perform a single function within the digital curation and preservation process.  

The concept of a microservice was developed by the California Digital Library (CDL), which in 2009 introduced a new approach to the curation and preservation of digital objects. This reconceptualization challenged the assumption that ‚Äúthe curation and preservation of digital objects required the installation and operation of a single, long-lived application combining the necessary functions behind one user interface.‚Äù  

Instead, CDL proposed that ‚Äúsmall, relatively simple utilities would pose fewer challenges in their development, deployment, maintenance, and enhancement than a large, integrated system, especially in the context of constant technological change.‚Äù Additionally, they noted that users could ‚Äúeasily adapt a set of distributed services to local conditions in different divisions and departments of the university, and easily replace each of them upon their obsolescence.‚Äù

<img src="img/week_04_aspace.png">

<!--presenter notes

ArchivesSpace (aka ASpace) is an archival system primarily used throughout the accessioning, arrangement and description of archival collections. The data entered
into ASpace can be used to produce finding aids in EAD XML format, so they may be viewed on the web.

Collections, or bodies of work, are called ‚Äúresources‚Äù. Within each resource, you will find various levels of hierachy that describe how a particular body of work is arranged, such as series or sub-series, which in ArchivesSpace are known as "archival objects". Archival objects can also be rolled up into what are known as "Top containers", which represent the physical containers/boxes that may be requested or circulated in a reading room or other special collection setting.

DSpace is an open-source repository platform. If you were to encounter an institution that uses DSpace, what you, as the user would ultimately see is some sort of catalog.

This is a screencapture from the DSpace website using NYU's Faculty Digital Archive, but you can see that DSpace essentially looks and behaves like a library or archive catalog.

The article you read about the Bentley Archivematica - ASpace - DSpace integration maps out their integration with the Digital Curation Center or DCC Lifecycle Model.
Before we look at the Bentley Library example, we should understand what the DCC Model is, what it is for, and how it differs from the OAIS, specifically.

<!--presenter notes

The DCC Curation Lifecycle Model provides a high-level graphical overview of the stages required for successful curation and preservation of data, starting from initial conceptualization or receipt. This model can be used to plan activities within an organization or consortium to ensure all necessary stages are undertaken in the correct sequence. 

It enables granular functionality to be mapped against the lifecycle, helping to define roles and responsibilities and to build a framework of standards and technologies for implementation. Additionally, it supports the identification of extra steps that may be required, actions that are unnecessary for specific situations or disciplines, and ensures that processes and policies are thoroughly documented.

For more information, refer to the [DCC Curation Lifecycle Model PDF](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/publications/DCCLifecycle.pdf).

# Digital Curation

__Digital curation__ encompasses the selection, preservation, maintenance, collection, and archiving of digital assets, including data, documents, multimedia, and other digital objects. It involves managing the entire lifecycle of digital content to ensure its usability, integrity, authenticity, and accessibility over time.

Here‚Äôs the cleaned-up version:

---

The Bentley Historical Library's integrated system achieved the following:

- Provided archivists with access to the ArchivesSpace interface directly from the context of the Archivematica system. This allowed them to use information generated during the Archivematica ingest process to inform appraisal tasks.  
- Enabled archivists to view ArchivesSpace resource records, add or edit archival descriptions, and create digital object instances in the finding aid‚Äîall without switching over to ArchivesSpace, using a tab within Archivematica.  
- Integrated Archivematica with DSpace to facilitate the deposit of Archival Information Packages (AIPs) into its preservation repository. Once deposited, the system returned a unique resource identifier (URI) to the ArchivesSpace access portal, enabling users to search for and access digital content.

# Application Programming Interface (API)

<!--presenter notes

APIs provide a way for different software applications to communicate and request services or data from each other without needing to understand the internal workings of the other system. They enable applications to interact and collaborate, simplifying the development of interoperability.  

While not always required, APIs often use web protocols‚Äîsets of instructions specific to computers or servers within a network‚Äîto execute requests, update data, and perform other tasks.

# API Endpoint

An API endpoint is a specific point of interaction between an API and the outside world. It is typically represented by a URL where the API can receive requests and send responses.

<!--presenter notes

ArchivesSpace provides a list of API endpoints. An API endpoint is a specific point of interaction between an API (Application Programming Interface) and the outside world, typically represented by a URL where the API can receive requests and send responses.

ArchivesSpace offers online documentation for all available endpoints. Using our cooking analogy, an endpoint is like browsing the menu of a restaurant.

In this case, I want to "order up" a list of repositories. To do this, I would search the ASpace REST API documentation for the keyword "repository" to see what it offers. Sure enough, there is an endpoint called "Get a List of Repositories," which seems to be exactly what I need.

You can check out the documentation here: [Get a List of Repositories](https://archivesspace.github.io/archivesspace/api/#get-a-list-of-repositories)

The documentation tells me that the specific endpoint is called `/repositories`. So, what does this mean for me?

# Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

The underlying protocol used on the web to exchange data between computers using the world wide web.

---

# https://thebestestwebsite.net/

Translation: "Using the **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**, retrieve the contents of the resource specified after the Uniform Resource Identifier marker (`://`) (e.g., `thebestwebsite.net`) and render it on my screen."

<!--presenter notes

Let‚Äôs unpack what we just said about APIs and the web. Why do they often go hand in hand?  

A common way we send instructions to other computers around the world is by opening a web browser and typing in a URL to access a website. Here we are unknowingly prompting our web browser to send instructions to a server somewhere in the world.

We are all very used to using HTTP for our own, human-centric purposes, especially for browsing the web. However, websites and the servers that host them contain parts or areas that enable them to speak to other computers, with or without a human prompting that communication.

<!--presenter notes

In the Bentley integration system, we learned that Archivematica, a web-based system, can talk to ASpace, another web-based system, using an API. They do this
using a combination of both the HTTP protocol, as well as another protocol known as REST.

# REpresentational State Transfer (REST)

Representational State Transfer **(REST)** is a set of instructions that are transmitted between computers using HTTP.

Common methods include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

<td width="50%" valign=top>
<span style="font-size: 50px;">üñ•Ô∏è
<br>Computer A: "Hello, can I <b>GET</b> some information from you?"
</td>

<td valign=top>
<span style="font-size: 50px;">üñ•Ô∏è
<br>Computer B: "Sure, here you go."
</td>
</table>

---

## REST Method: POST

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign=top>
<span style="font-size: 50px;">üñ•Ô∏è
<br>Computer A: "Hello, can I add a new record?"
</td>

<td valign=top>
<span style="font-size: 50px;">üñ•Ô∏è
<br>Computer B: "Sure, the record has been added."
</td>
</table>

---

## REST Method: PUT

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign=top>
<span style="font-size: 50px;">üñ•Ô∏è
<br>Computer A: "Hello, can I update an existing record?"
</td>

<td valign=top>
<span style="font-size: 50px;">üñ•Ô∏è
<br>Computer B: "Sure, the existing record has been updated."
</td>
</table>

---

## REST Method: DELETE

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign=top>
<span style="font-size: 50px;">üñ•Ô∏è
<br>Computer A: "Hello, can I remove this record?"
</td>

<td valign=top>
<span style="font-size: 50px;">üñ•Ô∏è
<br>Computer B: "Sure, the record has been deleted."
