# Tech Stack ðŸ¥ž

## Overview

In this activity, you will review the online documentation for an assigned collecting institution to identify the systems it uses to support digital preservation and archiving operations. This is sometimes referred to as a technical stack or "tech stack", hence the name of the activity.

The goal is to help you understand the range of digital preservation systems, real life examples of their implementation, and how they interact to support the stewardship life cycle of data objects.

## Institution Selection

At the start of this activity in class, I will assign each student an institution listed in the <a href="https://airtable.com/app90l0hAVV99Yym6/shrNexpZL58DjSgPO" target="_blank">Tech Stack Airtable gallery</a>.

## Describe the Stack

You will create a three-slide mini-presentation to share with the class during the upcoming session. Your slides should be structured and address pertinent details as follows:

1. **Slide 1: Primary Digital Repository System:**
* Name the institution's main digital repository system.
* Describe its primary functions and any notable details about its use.

2. **Slide 2: Adjacent Systems:**
* Identify 2-3 systems that work alongside the primary repository system.
* Briefly describe each system and its role within the tech stack.

3. **Slide 3: Bring it all together**
* Provide a visual representation of how the systems work together to support digital preservation and archiving.
* By "visualize" you can use diagrams, flowcharts, drawings, illustrations, or anything else, to illustrate the relationships.

## Submission

Submit your slide deck via Brightspace in one of the following formats:
* A link to a shared online slide deck.
* An attached export of your slide deck.
