Hi! Welcome to the Digital Archives (HIST-GA-1011) website. This site contains a course description, weekly schedule and assigned readings, course assignment and weekly activity descriptions, and other course materials/resources. We will use this site, as well as Brightspace, throughout the course of this class.

<b>Why Github?</b>
This site is built using Github Pages, a popular platform that allows me to properly version and track changes to the syllabus over time. This is also an effort to de-Googleify my class, and make my syllabus and all information here readily available (and if I decide to move on from being an Adjunct, my syllabus will not be tied up to my NYU accounts). You can see a list of my commits <a href="https://github.com/digital-archives/HISTGA1011/commits/main/" target="_blank">here</a>. I try to be as descriptive as possible when describing changes, but am not always great about that!
