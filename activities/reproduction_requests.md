# Reproduction Requests Activity

## Introduction
Requests for digital images of archival material are increasingly common in archives. Many repositories now allow patrons to take photos during the course of their research for personal use. Scholars, documentarians, museums, educational programs and others frequently request high quality digital reproductions and for permission to use the material in a way that goes beyond personal use. It is important and very helpful to archivists to have established policies in place they can point patrons to for reproductions.

****

For this activity, pretend you are the archivist who has received a request for digital files or permission to use archival material beyond personal use. You need to evaluate the request and make a determination of how to proceed. Each student will be assigned 1 reproduction request to evaluate along with supporting documentation that may offer helpful information. In the class next week we will take 10 minutes at the beginning of lecture to review your requests, so please come to class ready to _very succinctly_ explain your request and how you would proceed based on your findings.

****

The requests are located in the shared google drive folder labeled [Reproduction Requests](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cCI-ReqwtJX5FgESTdnOmVCyAOREW1Nf). Each folder contains a word doc with the original request email and useful files you would have access to as the archivist like associated finding aids and gift agreements.

For reference:

- Centro’s Digital Collections Portal: <https://centroca.hunter.cuny.edu/>   

- Centro’s reproduction services page information (note: I didn’t include any reproduction forms as mentioned on this page, since the emails do a better job of laying out the requests and we’ve moved to an integrated form that these requests predate): <https://centropr.hunter.cuny.edu/library/reproduction-services>

To guide your analysis, in Brightspace submit the answers to the following questions:

1. Summarize request.

2. Who holds the copyright? Where did you find that information?

3. What would be your response to the patron?

   - Can Centro provide permissions to use the material? If not, what do you or the patron need to do?

   - Is there any further information you need? What is it? Where would you presumably look for it?

4. Any permissions must be confirmed in writing (Centro issues a permissions document that is signed by the archivist and requester for material Centro holds the rights to) and any payment required must be received before Centro will provide the digital files (this is pretty standard practice). For this request what would need to be done to provide the digital files to the patron once any permissions/payments have been received? (i.e. does anything need digitization or to be re-digitized to a higher quality or can you provide available digital files?)

   - Note: 

     1. The[ reproductions services page](https://centropr.hunter.cuny.edu/library/reproduction-services) might be helpful.

     2. Any requests with links that work to the images or identifiers (ex. PuBe\_b01\_f02\_0003) that can be searched for in the [Centro Digital Collections Portal](https://centroca.hunter.cuny.edu/Front/Index) are available digitally as 300 dpi TIFFs. 

     3. Any links that don’t work/identifiers that can’t be found would need to be searched for in the backend server or re-digitized. 

     4. Any files without digital representation or request for higher than 300dpi TIFF would need to be digitized

     5. Centro doesn’t do in-house AV digitization so they outsource to two vendors: AV Geeks and BAVC Media and the patron pays for the base digitization and Centro pays for additional preservation services like checksums and ProRes copies.
