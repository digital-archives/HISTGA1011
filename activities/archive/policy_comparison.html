<h1 id="preservation-policy-comparison">Preservation Policy Comparison</h1>

<p>This activity introduces students to digital preservation policies in the field at-large, in terms of how they are structured, what they cover, and how they differ from one institutional repository to another.</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>The objective of this activity is for students to review two current preservation policies and compare them to one another. By analyzing and contrasting these policies, students will gain a better understanding of the variations in digital preservation approaches across different institutions.</p>

<p>Remember to critically evaluate and compare the policies, considering their implications for digital preservation practices. This activity will enhance your understanding of real-world preservation policies and their role in safeguarding digital materials.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Choose Two Preservation Policies for Review:</strong> In this step, you will select two preservation policies for analysis. You have the option to choose from the list of policies provided below, or you can independently search for and select any two policies of your liking. To ensure a meaningful comparison, it is recommended that the two policies you choose are from institutions of a similar institution type. The two policies listed below are examples of  policies from large university library systems:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://guides.library.cornell.edu/ecommons/policy" target="_blank">Cornell University - Digital Repository Policies</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.lib.washington.edu/preservation/preservation-services/digitization-and-digital-preservation/digital-preservation-policy#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20Washington%20Libraries,University%20for%20the%20foreseeable%20future." target="_blank">University of Washington Libraries - Digital Preservation Policy</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Review and Analyze the Selected Policies:</strong> Once you have chosen the two policies, carefully read through both of them. Pay attention to the structure, content, and key elements presented in each policy. As you review the policies, consider the following questions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What is the scope of each policy? What types of digital materials do they cover?</li>
      <li>What are the preservation strategies and methods outlined in each policy?</li>
      <li>Are there any specific requirements or recommendations related to metadata in the policies?</li>
      <li>Do the policies provide information about access and user considerations?</li>
      <li>Are there any notable differences or similarities between the two policies?</li>
      <li>Do these policies mention anything about related institutional mandates, or are otherwise related to any other sort of broader institutional policies, frameworks or missions? If so, what are they, and how are they related?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Compare and Contrast:</strong> You may either narrate your comparison, or alternatively create a table or matrix to compare and contrast the two preservation policies. Include the key points and findings from your analysis, highlighting both differences and similarities. You can use a tool like Microsoft Word, Excel, or Google Sheets to create your comparison table.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Submit Your Analysis:</strong> After completing the comparison, submit your analysis in Brightspace.</li>
</ol>
