Welcome to the Digital Archives (HIST-GA-1011) website. This site contains a course description, weekly schedule and assigned readings, course assignment and weekly activity descriptions, and other course materials/resources. We will use this site, as well as Brightspace, throughout the course of this class.

<b>Why Github?</b>
This site is built using Github Pages. If you've never heard of or used Github, that's okay! The only thing to really know about it is that it is good for a a couple of things: writing and versioning documents, and publishing/hosting a decent looking website for free. This is also an effort to de-Googleify my class, and make my syllabus and all information here readily available (and if I decide to move on from being an Adjunct, my syllabus will not be tied up to my NYU accounts). You can see a list of my commits <a href="https://github.com/digital-archives/HISTGA1011/commits/main/" target="_blank">here</a>.
