### Extra Credit Opportunity
Students can earn up to **3 extra credit points** by reaching out to a repository and setting up a time to talk with an archivist or a preservation/digital archives practitioner. To receive credit, students must, in their abstract, turn in a summary of their conversation with the project abstract (minimum 300 words) and reflect on how the discussion informs their final project.

Extra credit will be applied to the Final Project score.
