Hello! Welcome to the Digital Archives (HIST-GA-1011) course site, containing all things related to the class. Here, you'll find the <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/syllabus/" target="_blank">course details</a>, <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/schedule/" target="_blank">week-by-week schedule listing assigned readings, activities and assignment due dates</a>, and descriptions for both <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/assignments/" target="_blank">assignments</a> and <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/activities/" target="_blank">weekly activities</a>. We will use this site alongside <a href="https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/430363" target="_blank">Brightspace</a> (used primarily for assignment submissions) throughout the semester.

<b>Why GitHub?</b>
This site is built using GitHub Pages, a platform that allows for writing, versioning and hosting documents, while also making it easy to publish a functional website for free.

If GitHub is new to you, don't worry! You won't need to use it directly for this course. For now, just know that it helps keep class materials accessible and organized. Building this site on GitHub also reflects a conscious decision to reduce reliance on platforms like Google and Brightspace. This ensures that course content is is openly available and not tied to institutional accounts, and in a readable format (markdown) that would make it easier to transition this content to another platform if need be.

You can view a history of updates to the site <a href="https://github.com/digital-archives/HISTGA1011/commits/main/" target="_blank">here</a> (aka the commit log).
