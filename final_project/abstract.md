# Abstract Checklist

**Suggested Length:** 2-3 pages

Before writing your abstract, choose a collection from an existing institution that will serve as the basis for your Digitization Project Plan. The collection you choose to work with should have these characteristics:
- Is described online by an archival finding aid
- Is not yet digitized (i.e. does not yet have digital surrogates made available online)
- Contains formats other than paper; i.e. email, moving image materials, born-digital materials, datasets, websites or social media archives

Although not required, you are encouraged to schedule an on-site or virtual visit to your chosen repository, yours and the archivist’s time and capacity permitting, either to help inform your abstract, final project approach, or both.

Submit an abstract for your final project that includes these details (1-2 sentences per checklist item is enough):
