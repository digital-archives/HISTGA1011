# Abstract

## Overview

Your **abstract** serves as an early-stage check-in for your **Digitization Project Plan**. It is an opportunity to begin defining the critical components of your final project and to ensure you have selected a **suitable collection** to work with.

Before writing your abstract, **choose a collection** from an existing institution that will serve as the foundation for your project. The collection must meet the following criteria:

- It is **described online** by an archival **finding aid**  
- It is **not yet digitized** (i.e., no digital surrogates are available online)  
- It **contains materials beyond paper-based formats**, such as:
  - Email
  - Moving image materials
  - Born-digital materials
  - Datasets
  - Websites or social media archives  

While not required, you are encouraged to schedule an on-site or virtual visit with your chosen repository, provided it is feasible for you and the archivist. This may help inform both your abstract and your final project approach.
