# Final Project

## Overview

For your final project, you will develop a **Digitization and Access Plan** for undigitized or currently inaccessible materials. This will take the form of a **written paper** and an **accompanying presentation**, which you will deliver on the last day of class.

To guide your progress, you will submit an **abstract** mid-way through the semester as a check-in to ensure you have identified a suitable collection and are on track with your project. (See the <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/schedule/" target="_blank">class schedule</a> for details.)

## Scenario

_You are an archivist working in the special collections department of [organization/institution of your choice]. As part of an initiative to enhance digital access, you have identified one or more collections in the institutionâ€™s finding aids that contain **undigitized or currently inaccessible materials**, such as analog media, obsolete digital formats, or physical documents without existing digital surrogates._

_Recognizing your expertise in digital preservation workflow management, the Director of Special Collections has appointed you as **Project Lead**. Your task is to analyze how your institution currently handles digital access and preservation, identify gaps or areas for improvement, and propose enhancements. Your proposal may incorporate strategies from other institutions, emerging best practices, or new technologies to strengthen the institutionâ€™s digital preservation program."_

_This project requires you to "start from scratch," meaning you must choose materials that **are not already digitized or available online**. This ensures that you will critically analyze the challenges involved in digital preservation, including selection criteria, technical workflows, metadata creation, and access strategies._

## ðŸ“Œ Selection Criteria

To ensure a well-rounded project, your chosen collection must meet the following criteria:

- **Your collection must include materials beyond standard paper-based formats.**
- While some **flat materials** (e.g., photographs, maps, manuscripts) may be included, **your project cannot focus exclusively on paper-based materials that only require scanning or photography.**
- Your project must engage with at least **one other format**, such as:
  - **Magnetic media** (e.g., audiotapes, videotapes, floppy disks, hard drives)
  - **Optical media** (e.g., CDs, DVDs)
  - **Born-digital files** requiring file format migration or emulation

## Project Goals

Your final paper and presentation should:
- **Demonstrate the significance** of the collection and why it should be prioritized for digitization.
- **Articulate the technical and logistical considerations** of the digitization/transfer process.
- **Explain how the project aligns with institutional priorities** and contributes to broader digital preservation efforts.
- **Persuade senior leadership** to support and fund your proposal by presenting a compelling case for its impact.

This project is an opportunity to apply **digital preservation principles** in a real-world context, critically engage with **selection and access strategies**, and develop skills in **planning and advocacy** within archival institutions.
