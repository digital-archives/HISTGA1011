# Scripting Reflection

### Why Scripting?
In an era of rapidly growing digital collections, archivists often encounter tasks that are too time-consuming to perform manually. While you don’t need to be a full-fledged programmer, having a basic understanding of scripting can help you to at least imagine ways to better automate and manage repetitive processes.

For this activity, you’ll explore a real-life example of code used by a repository and translate it into **pseudocode**. Think of pseudocode as plain language that explains the steps a script takes to accomplish its task.

## Steps

### **1. Select a Script**
- In class, you’ll choose a script from [Ruth Tillman’s ArchivesSnake GitHub repository](https://github.com/ruthtillman/ASpaceASnake). Each script performs a small job using the Python programming language and the ArchivesSnake Library.
- Look for files that end in `.py` (e.g., `download-subjects.py`). Do not select files with other extensions like `.md` or `.txt`.

---

### **2. Understand the Script**
- Open your chosen script by clicking its name.
- Break the script into logical chunks and write **pseudocode** to describe what each section does. 
- Use Ruth’s helpful comments (lines starting with `#`) as clues. They’re there to explain what the code is doing! Unfortunately not all of Ruth's scripts have these sorts of comments. However, there is a list of each script name, followed by a brief description, that you might also find useful.

### **3. Write Your Pseudocode**
- Follow the structure from this week’s slide deck: code on one side, pseudocode on the other.
- Example pseudocode: "This line checks if a folder exists. If it doesn’t, it creates the folder."

---

### **4. Use All Resources**
You are encouraged to use any resource to help you understand the code:
- **Documentation** (e.g., ArchivesSnake, ArchivesSpace)
- **Online Communities** (e.g., Stack Overflow)
- **Video Tutorials** (e.g., YouTube)
- **Generative AI** (e.g., chatbots)

**You don’t need to cite your sources**. The goal is to understand what the script is doing, not to write a formal paper.

---

### **5. Ask for Help**
If you’re unsure about any part of the script, it’s okay! Feel free to write something like:
> "I think this line initializes a connection to a server, but I’m not entirely sure."

Uncertainty is part of learning, and you’re not expected to deeply dissect every detail.

---

### **6. Submit Your Work**
- Spend **1-2 hours** on this activity. Don’t overthink it!
- Submit your pseudocode to **Brightspace** by **Sunday night**.
- Use clear formatting to separate code from pseudocode for easy readability.
- I will not be grading you on whether or not your pseudocode is right. Instead, I want to see you made an effort to figure out, on a high-level, what the script was trying to accomplish.

### **7. Share Your Findings**
Be ready to discuss your pseudocode and findings in class next week.
