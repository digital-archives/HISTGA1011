<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Your final paper is an opportunity to fully articulate your Project Plan and demonstrate how you have applied digital preservation principles to a real-world archival collection.</p>

<p>This report should build on your abstract submission, expanding on the critical components of your project, including selection rationale, digitization workflows, access strategies, and long-term sustainability considerations.</p>

<p>The final paper should also align with the structure of your presentation, ensuring that you can clearly communicate your projectâ€™s goals, challenges, and impact.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="general-requirements">General Requirements</h2>

<ul>

<h2 id="-paper-structure">ðŸ”– Paper Structure</h2>

<p>Your final report should follow this structured format to ensure consistency and clarity.</p>

<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Provide a high-level overview of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The problem or goal your project addresses</li>
  <li>Why your department is positioned to tackle this issue</li>
  <li>Your proposed approach</li>
  <li>The expected outcomes of your digitization project</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-rationale">2. Rationale</h3>
<p>Explain why your institution is prioritizing this collection over others. Consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Long-term impact on research, teaching, public programming, social movements, or marginalized histories</li>
  <li>Circulation statistics and how digitization may increase engagement</li>
  <li>Physical fragility and how digital surrogates may reduce wear and tear</li>
  <li>Compliance with preservation standards</li>
  <li>Alignment with institutional goals and priorities</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-stakeholders">3. Stakeholders</h3>
<p>List staff, departments, or external partners involved in your project. For each, specify:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Their role and responsibilities</li>
  <li>How they contribute to the projectâ€™s success and sustainability</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-scope--inventory">4. Scope &amp; Inventory</h3>
<p>Provide a summary of your collectionâ€™s form and extent.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the collection (formats, volume, content types)</li>
  <li>What is in scope for digitization</li>
  <li>What is out of scope (e.g., commercial recordings, duplicate materials)</li>
  <li>Link to the finding aid or catalog record, if available</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-selection-criteria--prioritization">5. Selection Criteria &amp; Prioritization</h3>
<p>Describe the order in which materials will be digitized, considering the institutionâ€™s existing access methods, technological limitations, and institutional priorities. Identify any challenges in the current system that may impact digitization workflows or user access. Considerations may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Format and condition</li>
  <li>Copyright and legal restrictions</li>
  <li>Dependence on specific hardware/software</li>
  <li>Other institutional priorities</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-preservation-approach">6. Preservation Approach</h3>
<p>Describe your methodology and cite national standards and best practices where applicable. If you depart from existing practices, explain why and how your approach remains interoperable.</p>

<h3 id="7-end-to-end-workflow">7. End-to-End Workflow</h3>
<p>Outline the full workflow for your project, covering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Acquisition and accessioning</li>
  <li>Archival processing, appraisal, and description</li>
  <li>Digitization preparation (in-house or vendor-based)</li>
  <li>Digital repository ingestion and file storage</li>
  <li>Additional processing (OCR, auto-transcription, normalization, QC, rights clearance)</li>
  <li>Long-term preservation strategies (backups, data integrity, disaster planning)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="8-discovery-access--use">8. Discovery, Access &amp; Use</h3>
<p>Explain how users currently access materials at your institution. Identify limitations (e.g., discoverability, user experience, metadata structure). Compare access models at other institutions and discuss how similar approaches could improve your institutionâ€™s access strategy, or suggest improvements to the user experience, features, and functionality.</p>

<p>Ensure this section aligns with any visualizations/diagrams/workflows in the appendix and in your presentation.</p>

<h3 id="9-technical-specifications--standards">9. Technical Specifications &amp; Standards</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Software and hardware: Identify tools used in the workflow</li>
  <li>File formats: Define submission, preservation, and access formats</li>
  <li>Resolution and sample rates: Outline minimum standards for digitized files</li>
  <li>Quality control: Describe how files will be assessed</li>
  <li>Metadata: Identify schemas for descriptive, administrative, preservation, technical, and access/catalog metadata</li>
  <li>Access platform: Explain how users will interact with the collection</li>
  <li>Rights and restrictions: Discuss potential copyright or privacy concerns</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="10-front-end-experience">10. Front-End Experience</h3>
