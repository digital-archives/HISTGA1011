# Scripting Reflection Paper

In an era of growing digital collections in collecting institutions, archivists must acquaint themselves with common scripting languages to automate tasks that would otherwise be laborious to perform manually. While it is not essential for archivists to become full-fledged programmers, it is crucial for them to understand the significance of scripting in their field.

## Assignment Details

1. **Language Selection**: Begin by selecting one of the following programming languages commonly used in digital repositories. This list is not exhaustive; you may choose an alternative language if it aligns with your interests:

   - Python: [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
   - The Programming Historian: [Programming Historian Lessons](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/)
   - ffmprovisr (ffmpeg): [ffmprovisr Documentation](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/)
   - Bash Scripting: [GNU Bash Manual](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html)
   - Practical Technology for Archivists: [Issue 1](https://practicaltechnologyforarchives.org/issue1/)
   - OpenRefine + Regular Expression (Regex): [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/)
   - Command line: [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html)

2. **Learning**: Dedicate 3-4 hours to learning your chosen programming language using the provided resources. The objective is not to become an expert developer but to grasp the language's fundamentals and syntax. Please note that this assignment requires you to use free or no-cost tutorials.

3. **Real-Life Example**: Explore a real-world example where a digital repository automates a part of its operations using the programming language you learned. Many digital repositories share their process and policy documentation online, often through platforms like GitHub. Here are a few examples:

   - The New York Public Library's Digital Archives Department employs a Python script called [report_ftk_extents.py](https://github.com/NYPL/digarch_scripts/blob/main/src/digarch_scripts/report/report_ftk_extents.py), accompanied by a [README document](https://github.com/NYPL/digarch_scripts/tree/main/extents) explaining its installation and usage in the Preservation and Collections Processing Department.

   - The Rockefeller Archives (RAC) provides extensive documentation on their GitHub repository, including information about their [Aurora web application](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/aurora). This application receives, virus-checks, and validates transfers of digital archival records, facilitating archivists in appraisal and accessioning processes.

## Reflection Paper

Write a 3-5 page reflection paper addressing the following points:

- **Background**: Describe your background or prior experience in programming or scripting, if any.

- **Language Selection**: Explain why you chose the particular programming language for this assignment.

- **Learning Process**: Detail your approach to learning the chosen language, including any challenges faced and how you overcame them.

- **Software/Tools**: Specify whether you had to install new software or applications to work with the selected language, and if so, provide details.

- **Key Learnings**: Share what you have learned during your study of the language, focusing on its practical applications.

- **Challenges Faced**: Discuss the challenges or difficulties you encountered and your strategies for addressing them.

- **Real-Life Example**: Analyze the real-life example you found, including its name, whether it operates as a standalone script or in conjunction with other scripts/commands, and any dependencies it relies on.

- **Automation**: Explain which aspect of the repository's operation this script automates and whether you can identify elements in the script that resemble what you learned during your programming tutorial.

- **Clarifying Confusions**: Identify any parts of the script that were confusing to you, describe what made them confusing, and outline the steps you took, including web searches, to clarify the issue. Mention any resources you found helpful in resolving the confusion.

## Conclusion

Wrap up your reflection paper by summarizing your overall experience, future intentions regarding learning the language further or exploring another language, and any advice you have for fellow archivists.
