# Final Project

## Overview

Utilizing the tools and information we have discussed over the semester, you will propose a digitization/transfer and access plan for un-digitized/transferred materials. Please see the **SCENARIO** section below.

During the final class, you will present your plan to the class. Presentations are expected to be accompanied by a slide deck, followed by a question and answer afterward. Part of the presentation grade will include asking questions and/or providing feedback during Q&As for presentations given.

An abstract scoping of your project will be due mid-way through the semester (see the <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/schedule/" target="_blank">class schedule</a>).

**SCENARIO:** _You are an archivist working in the special collections department of [organization/institution of your choice] who has decided that one or more collections should be digitized or transferred off their media, and made accessible to library users in some way._

_Recognizing your expertise and knowledge in digital preservation workflow management, the Director of Special Collections has appointed you Project Lead. This new role entails driving the development of a comprehensive Digitization Project Plan report, and presenting your findings to your colleagues. The end goal of the report and preservation is to not only convince senior leaders to fund this project but also advocate for the work your department does and garner support for a more robust overall digital preservation program at your institution._

## The Paper

Writing this report is an opportunity for you to think through a complete digital preservation project and identify and articulate what people, tools, and other resources are needed to put a digital preservation plan into action.

Presenting your findings provides an opportunity for you to practice discussing a project at a high level that speaks to a broad audience and answer questions about your decision-making around digital library program.

Overall, I want to see that you can take the concepts and information we have discussed over the semester and apply them to your own vision for digital preservation program success.

## The Presentation

**Length:** 15 minutes (10 minute presentation followed by a 5 minute question and answer session)

Presentations should be an overview of your proposed project, highlighting key information, features, and challenges of your project.

You are proposing this project for consideration to the class and professor who will serve as a digital preservation project proposal panel. Following the presentation, the panel will ask follow-up questions to learn more about your project and decisions. This is an opportunity to practice discussing your rationale and decisions based on the project you put together.

When serving as a panel member, ask questions to learn more about the project being presented and how the presenter will handle aspects of the project that you may not have come up during the presentation.
