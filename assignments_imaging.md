[Step 4: Write your individual reflection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QRRI_AQQhiBGp40NdR1yKyqASV5SoO48C74QuUedOYk/edit#heading=h.ukr4dyt2zm1h)


## Scenario
| _You are an archivist who works in the archival department of a medium-sized university archive. Your department is planning on writing a grant to garner funds for a digitization project. Your team has been tasked with devising a digitization plan, in the form of a report and inventory. Both documents will provide high-level details, cost and production time estimates, and document proposed schemas/standards._ _You will base your report on a collection from your institutional repository, containing mostly paper, photographic and other 2D materials (with some exceptions)._ |


## Step 1: Perform in-class pre-imaging and conservation review

**Convene with your assigned group (A or B) and prep documents:** 

- [ ] Have one group member open the shared [Assignments folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m_74KkdORh17jdqxcDw7HrbuRk0QV58e) and within it, make copies of the [Template - Imaging Review - Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iUBCTJHYKZWQrrBCZicBLftlPb9zH4SX88R12pCW2AQ/edit) and [Template - Imaging Review - Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ErWhb_SbsyWPzQ6CupKEnRq8GTA8Wc1oTRlrUhFLm_g/edit#gid=0).

* [ ] Within your copy of the inventory report, delete the tab containing the inventory for the other group.

- [ ] Share your Report and Inventory copies with other group members.

****

**Review these items with your group to come up with a preliminary plan of action:**

- [ ] General materials types in the Inventory

- [ ] For each material type group identified, determine:

  - [ ] What digitization equipment/technologies you will need

  - [ ] What staff roles/responsibilities are required to perform digitization tasks

- [ ] Consider whether all or just some of the items should be digitized, and reasons why

- [ ] Assess the condition of the material, flagging any materials that you might want assessed by a conservator before digitization

- [ ] How will digitization/scanning be done? Consider these factors:

  - [ ] Should techs digitize recto and verso of everything

  - [ ] Do you want blank versos digitized?

  - [ ] Do you want double page or single page spreads for multi page documents?

  - [ ] What order do you want the book cover/spine contents digitized?

  - [ ] Do you think material might need conservation/special handling before digitization?

  - [ ] Is there anything you want to skip?

- [ ] Any questions you have for Prof. Kidd


## Step 2: Consultation

Once your group has finished the initial review, approach me and let me know your plan. Use this time to ask me if you have any questions about these steps, your assigned collections, or anything else.


## Step 3: Write your group report

Once you have consulted with me, I will send you on your way to writing up your report.

- [ ] As a group, step through the [Imaging Review - Inventory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QRRI_AQQhiBGp40NdR1yKyqASV5SoO48C74QuUedOYk/edit#heading=h.v9rhdwq94sgt) and [Imaging Review - Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QRRI_AQQhiBGp40NdR1yKyqASV5SoO48C74QuUedOYk/edit#heading=h.jit5vbacrcbg) sections, containing instructions and guidance to determine estimates and other details.

****

_Note 2: You may need to flip back and forth between the Inventory and Report documents to complete steps listed below\._

****

- [ ] When you are done, assign one group member the responsibility to submit your group report in Brightspace.

- [ ] Each group member will also be responsible for a 1-page [individual reflection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QRRI_AQQhiBGp40NdR1yKyqASV5SoO48C74QuUedOYk/edit#heading=h.n3q8xh312ow2).


### Inventory

_Note: columns in the inventory highlighted in yellow are what you will be filling out._

****

**Pre-populated fields:**

- **Series:** Name of finding aid series containing the folder.

- **Box number:** Box label number. Since this is a folder-level list, box numbers may repeat themselves.

- **Folder number:** Folder label number

- **Content Estimate Count:** Estimated total count of Content Estimate Format.

- **Content Estimate Format:** Format of Content Estimate Count

- **Restrictions:** Access restriction statement/dates.

- **Condition:** Noted conservation issues.

****

**Fields to be filled out by groups for each folder:**

- **Workflow Type(s)_:_** Use the [Harvard Library Imaging Services Project Services Categories](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/DigitalImaging/Imaging+Services+Project+Services+Categories) to identify workflow type(s) for each folder.

- **Folder Name:** Enter each folder’s name based on the file-naming schema described in your Report.

- **Capture Device**: Based on your workflow selections from the HLIS site, identify the capture device you will need to digitize each folder.

- **Shot Count:** For each folder listed, enter in an estimated shot count based on the Content Estimate Count and Format.

- **Imaging Time:** Using the [DLF Digitization Cost Calculator](https://dashboard.diglib.org/), calculate the time it will take per workflow type in minutes. To determine these estimates, open the Calculator and enter the following details:

  - _Number of scans:_ Enter total number shots in the folder with the same workflow (sort the worksheet by Content Estimate). If you are using multiple workflows for 1 folder, you need to calculate time separately then add together.

  - _Staffing:_ List each staff name (enter their role here, no need to make up a name), type (hourly or salaried is fine), rate (guess!), and benefits (enter 20%)

_For every item below you enter data for, select your staff member name as the person doing the work, otherwise the task will not be included in the time total._

- _Capture Device:_ Select the capture device you listed in the Inventory (see the **Harvard to DLF Capture Device Table**).

  - Rights review: \[leave blank]

  - Make sure for each, select the staff performing these tasks.

- _Quality Control_

  - Select Level 1

  - Percentage of Material: 10% (feel free to adjust this!)

  - Make sure for each, select the staff performing these tasks.

- _Post Processing:_ \[skip]

- _Metadata:_ Select level 3 and input 32% for the percentage for material

- _Post Preparation_: \[skip]

- _Other_: \[skip]

- Select “Save and Continue”; input the total in minutes per Content Estimate Count/Format/Workflow type

* **Output File Type(s):** Identify the resulting preservation file types for the digitized material using the [Library of Congress Recommended Formats](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/TOC.html) as your guide (ignore the output options from the HLIS site.) Don’t worry about what the output of particular cameras or scanners are, since some output raw images; instead, focus your decision-making on the final output and assume any necessary conversion will occur during post-production.

* **Resolution:** Express in DPI (dots per inch). General recommendations are:

  - 300 dpi: optimal for most material (good balance between detail capture and file size)

  - 400 dpi: more detailed capture, consider for photography

  - 600 dpi: small items, a lot of detail

* **OCR (Y/N):** Do you want optical character recognition? Make sure you include this in the cost.

* **Cost:** Based on your selected workflows and shot counts, calculate the cost of digitization per folder using the costs per image listed in the [_Harvard Library Imaging Services Project Services Categories_](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/DigitalImaging/Imaging+Services+Project+Services+Categories).


### Report

- **Collection Name:** Remove the other group’s collection name.

- **Group members:** __List the names of each group member.

- **Scope:** Using your Inventory, summarize what and how much you will be digitizing.

- **Workflow:** Write out a step-by-step workflow that provides instructions for how collection items will be scanned/photographed (bullet point is fine). This workflow should be easily understood by the staff performing the digitization.

- **Selection criteria:** __Since there will be both overarching decisions and folder-specific decisions due to different item types, document why you selected or prioritized some or all folders, or excluded any material from digitization and why

- **File- and folder-naming schema:** __Assume your imaging output will be grouped by folder for post-production processing. What is the folder naming schema you will give to the batch folders? What information do you want to capture in the folder name? Provide your reasoning.

- **Staff:** List each staff and their role in your project.

- **Output file type(s):** __Summarize the file formats output as a result of digitization.

- **Estimated shot count total:** Provide total across all folders in your Inventory’s “Shot Count” column.

* **Estimated Imaging Time (minutes) total:** Provide total across all folders in your Inventory’s “Imaging Time” column.

* **Estimated project cost:** __Provide total cost across all folders in your Inventory’s “Cost” column.

* **Estimated production length:** Take the total amount of minutes listed in your inventory and convert into something more tangible, like days, weeks or months.

* **Full project notes and approaches:** Document the project-wide decisions you make and why. Folder-specific decisions should be documented at the folder level, but so you don’t need to repeat information at the folder level, document it here: What file format(s) did you select and why? Are there blanket digitization decisions you made, such as no blank versos? Etc.

* **Conservation Notes:** Detail what sort of conservation or stabilization treatments may be required for materials with condition issues, and comment on how this might affect production length or any other project details.


## Step 4: Write your individual reflection

Staff involved directly or indirectly on digitization projects all have different roles, responsibilities and perspectives. Write a 1 page reflection from the perspective of one of your staff members (each group member must select a different role). Highlight any decisions made and documented in the Report that implicate you, and how they may effect your day-to-day work: Try and pick one of these topics to reflect on:

- Prioritization of your work: Digitization projects often must be balanced with other tasks and projects assigned to you and your staff. How would you prioritize this work with your other assignments? How might staff communicate with one another to ensure proper lead time?

- Workplace conditions: Digitization activities can involve repetitive tasks in specific environments that can have an impact on workers’ health, physicality and well-being. For example, imaging technicians often work in dark, windowless rooms, multi-tasking between equipment and workstations. What might the Principal Investigator consider incorporating into the grant budget to accommodate for these workplace realities?
