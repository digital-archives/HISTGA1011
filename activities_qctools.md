# QCTools Audio/Visual Preservation Weekly Activity

## Introduction

In this activity you will be downloading, installing and using QCTools, a program that provides a way to analyze audio/visual transfer “artifacts”.

**Setup steps**

- Install the QCTools program (GUI): <https://bavc.org/programs/preservation/preservation-tools/>

* Download the video clip in the [A/V Preservation shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1im0K8WUMlUDFHWGxE3jDFQ113O6NOtvt) locally. Note: this video was transcoded from a VHS tape.

* Open the [Moving Image Preservation of Puget Sound (MIPoPS) QCTools Manual](https://sustainableheritagenetwork.org/system/files/atoms/file/QCTools%20Manual%20\(Printable%20Version\).pdf)

* Open the terminal/command line and QCTools in another.

**Activity steps**

_Analyze the video file in QCTools using graphs_

- Open the QCTools program and drag/drop the video file you downloaded. This may take a few seconds to import.

- Play the file back by pressing your Space bar.

- Click the **Filters layout** button.

- Read Ashley Blewer’s slides on filters starting from page #14 to 31 (<https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/qctools.html#14>) (use your right arrow key to navigate). Keep this information handy as you apply more filters to the video file.

- On the left-hand side of the Filters layout, click the filters drop-down and select “Broadcast Range Pixels”. Play the video back and notice what the filter does to the video.

- Apply other filters to your video, such as the Histogram, Oscilloscope, Vectorscope and Waveform (hint: you can check off multiple filters and view them side-by-side, including the original video by selecting “Normal” in the drop-down).

- Notice how the clip has some issues, especially to do with tracking near the beginning.

_Look up a transfer artifact: tracking_

- Open the A/V Artifact Atlas (<http://www.avartifactatlas.com/tags.html>) and click “Browse by format”. Select VHS.

- Click and read through the page about tracking errors, and how to use the QCTools graphs to detect tracking issues (Click the **Setup Filters** button in the top-left of the graphs screen to make sure the appropriate graphs are showing).

- Apply other filters and replay the video. Pay special attention to the parts of the clip with tracking issues. What do the other filters show you when tracking issues occur?

_Review the file’s metadata_

- In QCTools, click the **File list** button to open up a table of data results for your file.

- Open the QCTools cheat sheet: <https://github.com/bavc/qctools-documentation/blob/master/qctools/QCToolsWorkshopCheatSheet.pdf>

- Review the results. Note whether your QCTools report counts were way under, over or average, as far as the QCTools cheat sheet indicates are ideal limits/ranges for certain aspects of the video signal.

**Submit your reflection in Brightspace**

Create a text document and share it with me in Brightspace. In it, include this information:

- Aside from tracking, describe one other a/v “artifact” or any other issues you noticed with the picture or sound, noticed either by watching the video, and/or applying filters and/or looking over the metadata results alongside the QCTools Cheat Sheet.

- If you were performing this transfer yourself, how would you go about correcting or adjusting the video signal, and/or correcting the video post-transfer?
