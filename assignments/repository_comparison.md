## Introduction

In this assignment, you will select two digital repository systems and conduct a comprehensive comparison of their features, functionalities, and suitability for long-term preservation. The goal is to provide students with a deeper understanding of different repository options and their implications for digital archiving.

Use this assignment as an opportunity to gain practical insights into digital repository systems and their relevance to digital archiving practices. This may also help inform you when writing your Final Report, which requires digital repository systems be articulated in your proposed digitization plan.
