# Paper Requirements and Structure

## Overview

Your final paper is an opportunity to fully articulate your Project Plan and demonstrate how you have applied digital preservation principles to a real-world archival collection.  

This report should build on your abstract submission, expanding on the critical components of your project, including selection rationale, digitization workflows, access strategies, and long-term sustainability considerations.

The final paper should also align with the structure of your presentation, ensuring that you can clearly communicate your projectâ€™s goals, challenges, and impact.

---

## General Requirements

- **Length:** 10â€“12 pages of text *(not including required appendices and bibliography)*
- **Formatting:** 12-point font, double-spaced  
- **Citations:** Use any citation format, as long as you apply it consistently  

**Additional Notes:**  
âœ… Your paper should reference relevant **readings and resources** from the course, or from your own research.  
âœ… Use **appropriate in-text citations** and include a bibliography.  
âœ… **Visuals are encouraged** and may be embedded within the text or included in the appendix.

## ðŸ”– Paper Structure

Your final report should follow this structured format to ensure consistency and clarity.

### 1. Introduction  
Provide a high-level overview of:  
- The problem or goal your project addresses  
- Why your department is positioned to tackle this issue  
- Your proposed approach  
- The expected outcomes of your digitization project  

### 2. Rationale  
Explain why your institution is prioritizing this collection over others. Consider:  
- Long-term impact on research, teaching, public programming, social movements, or marginalized histories  
- Circulation statistics and how digitization may increase engagement  
- Physical fragility and how digital surrogates may reduce wear and tear  
- Compliance with preservation standards  
- Alignment with institutional goals and priorities  

### 3. Stakeholders  
List staff, departments, or external partners involved in your project. For each, specify:  
- Their role and responsibilities  
- How they contribute to the projectâ€™s success and sustainability  

### 4. Scope & Inventory  
Provide a summary of your collectionâ€™s form and extent.  
- Describe the collection (formats, volume, content types)  
- What is in scope for digitization  
- What is out of scope (e.g., commercial recordings, duplicate materials)  
- Link to the finding aid or catalog record, if available  

### 5. Selection Criteria & Prioritization  
Describe the order in which materials will be digitized, considering the institutionâ€™s existing access methods, technological limitations, and institutional priorities. Identify any challenges in the current system that may impact digitization workflows or user access. Considerations may include:
- Format and condition  
- Copyright and legal restrictions  
- Dependence on specific hardware/software  
- Other institutional priorities  

### 6. Preservation Approach  
Describe your methodology and cite national standards and best practices where applicable. If you depart from existing practices, explain why and how your approach remains interoperable.  

### 7. End-to-End Workflow  
Outline the full workflow for your project, covering:  
- Acquisition and accessioning  
- Archival processing, appraisal, and description  
- Digitization preparation (in-house or vendor-based)  
- Digital repository ingestion and file storage  
- Additional processing (OCR, auto-transcription, normalization, QC, rights clearance)  
- Long-term preservation strategies (backups, data integrity, disaster planning)  

### 8. Discovery, Access & Use  
Explain how users currently access materials at your institution. Identify limitations (e.g., discoverability, user experience, metadata structure). Compare access models at other institutions and discuss how similar approaches could improve your institutionâ€™s access strategy, or suggest improvements to the user experience, features, and functionality.

Ensure this section aligns with any visualizations/diagrams/workflows in the appendix and in your presentation.

### 9. Technical Specifications & Standards  
- Software and hardware: Identify tools used in the workflow  
- File formats: Define submission, preservation, and access formats  
- Resolution and sample rates: Outline minimum standards for digitized files  
- Quality control: Describe how files will be assessed  
- Metadata: Identify schemas for descriptive, administrative, preservation, technical, and access/catalog metadata  
- Access platform: Explain how users will interact with the collection  
- Rights and restrictions: Discuss potential copyright or privacy concerns  

### 10. Front-End Experience  
Describe who your intended users are and how they will engage with the collection. Consider:  
- User characteristics and needs  
- Features that will support discovery and access  
- Format-specific requirements (e.g., audio players for digitized tapes)  
- How the digital experience will replicate or enhance the physical experience  

This section should align with your mockup in the appendix.  

### 11. Anticipated Challenges & Risk Mitigation  
Identify potential obstacles and how you plan to address them, including:  
- Material-specific challenges  
- Workflow or policy gaps  
- Budget and resource constraints  
- Technical limitations  
- Sustainability concerns  
- Legal or rights-based risks  

Outline a long-term digital preservation plan, considering:  
- Institutional commitments required for storage, integrity, and access  
- Storage locations for preservation masters  
- Existing or missing institutional policies on digital collections  

---

## Appendices  
Include the following supporting documents:  

### End-User Experience Mockup  
- A visual representation of how users will search, browse, and access your digitized collection  
- Key features and functionalities of your access portal  
- Hierarchical relationships (e.g., multiple files for an audio cassette)  

### Workflow Diagram  
- A diagram mapping out your workflow from digitization to access  
- Ensure it visually aligns with your workflow narrative
