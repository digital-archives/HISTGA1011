# EaaSI Emulation Weekly Activity

## Introduction

For this week’s activity, we will be stepping through parts of Claire Fox and Ethan Gates’ Emulation Tutorial: <https://eaasi.gitlab.io/program_docs/intro-emulation-workshop/index.html>

****

This tutorial will give you some hands-on experience installing and using emulators, both on your computer and virtually through the EaaSI browser-based Sandbox: <https://sandbox.eaasi.cloud/eaasi/#/portal/welcome>

****

Here are the steps to take:

- Open the Setup page: (<https://eaasi.gitlab.io/program_docs/intro-emulation-workshop/setup.html>) and follow the steps in the “Installing Mini vMac” and “Downloading Sample Content” sections. Do not take steps listed under “Installing QEMU”.

- Open the Anatomy of a Computer Episode: <https://eaasi.gitlab.io/program_docs/intro-emulation-workshop/02-computers/index.html>

  - Read through the sections covering emulation basics

  - Do the Emulator Documentation Exercise

- Open the Emulation and Virtualization Applications Episode: <https://eaasi.gitlab.io/program_docs/intro-emulation-workshop/04-emulators/index.html>

  - Skip completely over the Create a Windows 95 Virtual Machine section.

  - Follow the steps in the **Create a Mac OS 6 Virtual Machine** section to the end.

- Lastly, open the Emulation-as-a-Service Episode: <https://eaasi.gitlab.io/program_docs/intro-emulation-workshop/06-eaasi/index.html>

  - The link to the EaaS Sandbox is currently not working so please use this URL instead: <https://sandbox.eaasi.cloud/eaasi/#/portal/welcome>

  - Follow all the steps in this section until the end.
