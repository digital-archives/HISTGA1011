# Tech Stack ðŸ¥ž

## Overview

In this activity, you will review the online documentation for an assigned collecting institution to identify the systems it uses to support digital preservation and archiving operations. This is sometimes referred to as a technical stack or "tech stack", hence the name of the activity.

The goal is to help you understand:
- the range of digital preservation systems
- real life examples of their implementation
- how these systems interact to support the stewardship life cycle of data objects.

## Institution Selection

At the start of this activity in class, I will assign you an institution listed in the <a href="https://airtable.com/app90l0hAVV99Yym6/shrNexpZL58DjSgPO" target="_blank">Tech Stack Airtable gallery</a> (your name and your assigned institution will be displayed in the gallery card; click into the card for access to a link (or 2) to some online documentation to assist in your research.)

## Describe the Stack

You will create a **3-slide mini-presentation** to share with the class next session. Please use the provided <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mPmi7bpo2wfwvYki0GFOJDFe_mdD3YLpvbHIpS9o_5U/edit#slide=id.g32f99f3c5ab_0_530" target="_blank">Google Slide template</a> so the slide decks are all formatted the same. To use this template, open it, and select File > Make a copy > Entire presentation to make a local copy in your GDrive.

Your slides should be structured as follows:

1. **Slide 1: Institution Name/Your Name:**
This is your introductory slide. Fill in:
- The name of your assigned institution
- Your name

2. **Slide 2: Systems List:**
List the **name of each system** the institution uses.
- If applicable, **hyperlink each system** to its official website or documentation
- If a particular system is unknown, simply list **"Unknown"** in its place.
- _Note: You will not be graded on completeness!_ Some institutions do not publicly share their full tech stack. Focus on what you can find using the documentation provided in Airtable.

### **3. Slide 3: System Demo**  

During your presentation, you will **demonstrate one system** from your institutionâ€™s tech stack. Your slide should serve as a guide for your demo and include:  

- A **URL** to the system you will be showcasing.  
- A brief **"tour" of the system**, covering:  
  - **What does it look like?** Highlight key features and user interface (UI) elements.  
  - **What can a user do?** (e.g., search, browse, view, play, interact).  
  - **Does it integrate with other systems?** If so, how?  

Not all systems are publicly accessible. Choose a system that has an **external-facing interface**, such as:  
- A **digital collections website**  
- A **finding aid portal**  
- A **digitization request form**  
- A **catalog record**  

ðŸ“Œ **Important:** When selecting your system, try to focus on one that **links to digitally preserved objects** to help illustrate its role in the institutionâ€™s digital preservation workflow.  

## Submission

**Submit your exported slide deck** via the Assignments section of Brightspace. In addition, please:
- Share your Google Slides link with me, or copy/paste the slide deck URL in the Brightspace Assignment submission form.
- Ensure your slides are fully visible (set permissions to allow viewing).

ðŸ”¹ I will be compiling all individual slide decks into a single class presentation, so be sure to update your sharing settings accordingly.

## Presentation

Be prepared to present next class!
- Each student will have ~5 minutes to demo their institutionâ€™s Tech Stack.
- You will walk us through one system from your stack, showcasing its interface and key features.
