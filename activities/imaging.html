<p class="highlight"><strong>SCENARIO:</strong> You are an archivist who works in the special collections department of a medium-sized university. Your department is planning on writing a grant to fund a digitization project. Your team has been tasked with devising a digitization plan, in the form of a report and inventory. Both documents will provide high-level details, cost and production time estimates, and document proposed schemas/standards. You will base your report on a collection from your institutional repository, containing mostly paper, photographic and other 2D materials (with some exceptions).</p>

<h2 id="step-1">Step 1: Perform in-class pre-imaging and conservation review</h2>
<p><strong>Convene with your assigned group and prepare/share the assignment documents:</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Have one group member open the shared <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e2OQoWaPbySWqyH2w8qbA95oBJB4BCKE?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Imaging and Conservation Activity - Templates</a> folder and have them make copies of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ipJfplMvKjXaupTq8RHEfGvyS1h2pzOlvrU2jtRfZ7w/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Template - Imaging Review - Report</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dEc1DEEJxvIa5UAxx6bgXsr3JC02RTxMh8xhcjg-Qes/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Template - Imaging Review - Inventory</a> into their Google Drive.</li>
  <li>Share the Google Drive folder with your group with read/edit permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Review the inventory, and start planning by discussing/taking notes about:</strong></p>

<p><em>Important note: There are two tabs in the Inventory spreadsheet. Please review them both!</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the general material types represented?</li>
  <li>What digitization equipment/technologies might be needed to digitize each material type group?</li>
  <li>Of the two collections represented, which collection should be digitized first? Why?</li>
  <li>What is the general condition of the materials? Use the spreadsheet to flag any materials that you think should be assessed by a conservator before digitization.</li>
  <li>How will digitization/scanning be done? Consider these factors:
    <ul>
      <li>Should techs digitize recto and verso of every single item (including those that are blank?) Why or why not?</li>
      <li>Do you want double page or single page spreads for multi-page documents?</li>
      <li>What order should book covers/spines be digitized?</li>
      <li>Is there anything that shouldn’t be digitized at this time?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What questions do you have for me?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-2">Step 2: Consultation</h2>
<p>Once your group has finished the initial review, approach me and let me know your plan. Use this time to ask me if you have any questions about these steps, digitization approach, or anything else.</p>

<h2 id="step-3">Step 3: Write your group report</h2>
<p>Once you have consulted with me, I will send you on your way to write up your group report. Use the Inventory and Report Guidance sections below which contain instructions and steps on how to fill out your Inventory, determine a cost estimate, and fill out your report.</p>

<h3 id="inventory">Inventory Spreadsheet Guidance</h3>

<p><em>Note: Any columns highlighted in yellow within the Inventory spreadsheet are the sections you will be filling out.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pre-populated field definitions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Series:</strong> Name of finding aid series containing the folder.</li>
  <li><strong>Box number:</strong> Box label number. Since this is a folder-level list, box numbers may repeat themselves.</li>
  <li><strong>Folder number:</strong> Folder label number</li>
  <li><strong>Content Estimate Count:</strong> Estimated total count of Content Estimate Format.</li>
  <li><strong>Content Estimate Format:</strong> Format of Content Estimate Count</li>
  <li><strong>Restrictions:</strong> Access restriction statement/dates.</li>
  <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Noted conservation issues.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fields (highlighted in yellow) to be filled for each folder:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Workflow Type(s)<em>:</em></strong> Use the <a href="https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/DigitalImaging/Imaging+Services+Project+Services+Categories" target="_blank">Harvard Library Imaging Services Project Services Categories (HLIS)</a> site to categorize workflow type(s) for each folder.</li>
  <li><strong>Folder Name:</strong> Enter each folder’s name based on the file-naming schema described in your Report.</li>
  <li><strong>Capture Device</strong>: Based on your workflow selections from the HLIS site, identify the capture device you will need to digitize each folder. Use the <strong>Harvard to DLF Capture Device Table</strong> below, which maps HLIS Workflow to DLF Calculator Device.</li>
  <li><strong>Shot Count:</strong> For each folder listed, enter in an estimated shot count based on the Content Estimate Count and Format.</li>
  <li><strong>Imaging Time:</strong> Using the <a href="https://dashboard.diglib.org/">DLF Digitization Cost Calculator</a>, calculate the time it will take per workflow type in minutes. To determine these estimates, open the Calculator and enter the following details:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Number of scans:</em> Enter total number shots in the folder with the same workflow (sort the worksheet by Content Estimate). If you are using multiple workflows for 1 folder, you need to calculate time separately then add together.</li>
      <li><em>Staffing:</em> List each staff name (enter their role here, no need to make up a name), type (hourly or salaried is fine), rate (guess!), and benefits (enter 20%)</li>
      <li><em>Capture Device:</em> Select the capture device you listed in the Inventory (see the <strong>Harvard to DLF Capture Device Table</strong>).</li>
      <li>Preparation of Original Material
        <ul>
          <li>Condition review: 100</li>
          <li>Fastener removal: [leave blank]</li>
          <li>Sorting material into items: [leave blank]</li>
          <li>Rights review: [leave blank]</li>
          <li>Make sure for each, select the staff performing these tasks.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Quality Control</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Select Level 1</li>
          <li>Percentage of Material: 10% (feel free to adjust this!)</li>
          <li>Make sure for each, select the staff performing these tasks.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Post Processing:</em> [skip]</li>
      <li><em>Metadata:</em> Select level 3 and input 32% for the percentage for material</li>
      <li><em>Post Preparation</em>: [skip]</li>
      <li><em>Other</em>: [skip]</li>
      <li>Select “Save and Continue”; input the total in minutes per Content Estimate Count/Format/Workflow type</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Output File Type(s):</strong> Identify the resulting preservation file types for the digitized material using the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/TOC.html">Library of Congress Recommended Formats</a> as your guide (ignore the output options from the HLIS site.) Don’t worry about what the output of particular cameras or scanners are, since some output raw images; instead, focus your decision-making on the final output and assume any necessary conversion will occur during post-production.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Express in DPI (dots per inch). General recommendations are:
    <ul>
      <li>300 dpi: optimal for most material (good balance between detail capture and file size)</li>
      <li>400 dpi: more detailed capture, consider for photography</li>
      <li>600 dpi: small items, a lot of detail</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>OCR (Y/N):</strong> Do you want optical character recognition? Make sure you include this in the cost.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Based on your selected workflows and shot counts, calculate the cost of digitization per folder using the costs per image listed in the <a href="https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/DigitalImaging/Imaging+Services+Project+Services+Categories" target="_blank">Harvard Library Imaging Services Project Services Categories</a> site.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="report">Report Guidance</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Collection Name:</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Group members:</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Using your Inventory, summarize what and how much you will be digitizing.</li>
  <li><strong>Workflow:</strong> Write out a step-by-step workflow that provides instructions for how collection items will be scanned/photographed (bullet point is fine). This workflow should be easily understood by the staff performing the digitization.</li>
  <li><strong>Selection criteria:</strong> Since there will be both overarching decisions and folder-specific decisions due to different item types, document why you selected or prioritized some or all folders, or excluded any material from digitization and why.</li>
  <li><strong>File- and folder-naming schema:</strong> Assume your imaging output will be grouped by folder for post-production processing. What is the folder naming schema you will give to the batch folders? What information do you want to capture in the folder name? Provide your reasoning.</li>
  <li><strong>Staff:</strong> List each staff and their role in your project.</li>
  <li><strong>Output file type(s):</strong> Summarize the file formats output as a result of digitization.</li>
  <li><strong>Estimated shot count total:</strong> Provide total across all folders in your Inventory’s “Shot Count” column.</li>
  <li><strong>Estimated Imaging Time (minutes) total:</strong> Provide total across all folders in your Inventory’s “Imaging Time” column.</li>
  <li><strong>Estimated project cost:</strong> __Provide total cost across all folders in your Inventory’s “Cost” column.</li>
  <li><strong>Estimated production length:</strong> Take the total amount of minutes listed in your inventory and convert into something more tangible, like days, weeks or months.</li>
  <li><strong>Full project notes and approaches:</strong> Document the project-wide decisions you make and why. Folder-specific decisions should be documented at the folder level, but so you don’t need to repeat information at the folder level, document it here: What file format(s) did you select and why? Are there blanket digitization decisions you made, such as no blank versos? Etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Conservation Notes:</strong> Detail what sort of conservation or stabilization treatments may be required for materials with condition issues, and comment on how this might affect production length or any other project details.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-4">Step 4: Write your individual reflection</h2>
<p>Staff involved directly or indirectly on digitization projects all have different roles, responsibilities and perspectives. Write a 1 page reflection from the perspective of one of your staff members (each group member must select a different role). Highlight any decisions made and documented in the Report that implicate you, and how they may effect your day-to-day work: Try and pick one of these topics to reflect on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prioritization of your work: Digitization projects often must be balanced with other tasks and projects assigned to you and your staff. How would you prioritize this work with your other assignments? How might staff communicate with one another to ensure proper lead time?</li>
  <li>Workplace conditions: Digitization activities can involve repetitive tasks in specific environments that can have an impact on workers’ health, physicality and well-being. For example, imaging technicians often work in dark, windowless rooms, multi-tasking between equipment and workstations. What might the Principal Investigator consider incorporating into the grant budget to accommodate for these workplace realities?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-5">Step 5: Submit your reports to Brightspace</h2>
<p>When you are done, each group member should submit the group report in Brightspace, as well as their individual report.</p>
