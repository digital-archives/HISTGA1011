# Weekly Activity: Archivematica Sandbox

## Introduction

A sandbox environment provides a hands-on experience with an application without affecting live data. In this exercise, we'll use Archivematica’s sandbox environment, exploring steps a digital archivist might take in processing born-digital archives.

Archivematica is an open-source digital preservation system designed to process and produce archival information packages (AIPs). It automates tasks through "microservices" to streamline SIPs transfer, ingest, and AIPs/DIPs creation, reducing processing time and errors.

**Important notes:**
- Archivematica clears sandbox data daily; your session and associated data/logs will be cleared.
- If a job fails, it's okay; note it and proceed to the next job (failed jobs won't halt the entire process).

## Steps to Take

1. Open [Archivematica Website](https://www.archivematica.org/en/) in a browser.
2. Click “DEMO” and then click “Launch”.
3. Login using these credentials: Username: demo@example.com, Password: demodemo. If a data breach warning appears, click OK; it's expected.
4. Click DOCUMENTATION and select Version 1.13.2 (stable-current).
5. In a separate browser tab, open the [Archivematica Quick-Start Guide](#).
6. Perform all tasks listed (#1-#5).
7. Once tasks are completed, write a 1-paragraph summary of your experience:
   - Were any Archivematica steps confusing? If so, specify and explain.
   - Did any jobs fail? If yes, which ones, and any guess on why?
   - If no failures, any general points of frustration or confusion?
   - How does Archivematica use rules for automation?
   - Did you edit a Processing Configuration? If yes, what did you edit?
