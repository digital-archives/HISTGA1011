# Repository Systems

## Definition
# Archival Repository

An __archival repository__ describes a physical location where an archive stores the physical holdings of their collection. Ideally, this is a secure and stable environment to combat against risk of damage from threats like water, heat and pests over the long-term both in service of preservation and access/retrieval.

<!--presenter notes 

Let’s start with a definition we are all probably fairly familiar with at this point: archival repository. An archival repository is a physical place where archives are kept. The physical components of an archival repository are stored on shelves (aka “stacks”) in, ideally, highly monitored, climate-controlled spaces, to ensure the materials are protected from risks posed by things like rodents, bugs, and humidity, but also organized in a way so items can be retrieved for access or remediation.

# Digital Repository

“A __digital repository__ is like the electronic equivalent of the library stacks; digital items are organized and searchable there, and they have a specific, persistent location so repository managers maintain intellectual control and researchers can find what they’re looking for. A digital repository does more than simply house digital objects online, it preserves their integrity in the long term.”

– Rachael Zipperer, Masters Candidate at the University of Texas School of Information, 2019

<!--presenter notes 

Link to Rachael’s blog post: https://www.tdl.org/2019/04/what-is-a-digital-repository/

Digital repositories function much in the same way as a “traditional” archival repository.

The way digital repositories are set up, managed and maintained in many ways are analogous to how physical stacks work, and why they are set up in the way they are set up. That said, a digital repository also has its differences. The main difference is in the way the things in the repository are managed. In archival repositories, you use rooms and shelves. In digital repositories, you use systems and databases, along with hardware, not just to store items securely, but manage them through their entire lifecycle across various digital preservation functions, such as ingest, access, and description.

<!--presenter notes

There are four main types of digital repository systems. Each type has a different focus and set of features:
1. Digital preservation systems
2. Institutional repositories
3. Digital asset management systems
4. Content management systems

  Digital Repository Systems
</div>

### Key Features:
- Drive digital preservation workflows
- Typically modeled after OAIS

### Examples:
- Samvera
- Preservica

<!--presenter notes

Digital preservation systems drive workflows specific to ingest, processing, auditing and analyzing digital objects entering into, being stored within, and being delivered from a digital repository. Many digital preservation systems take their queues from or
are directly modeled after the OAIS Reference Model. For a weekly activity, you will be testing out one widely-used digital preservation system called Archivematica.

  Institutional Repository
</div>

### Key Features:
- Manage intellectual works
- Common in research institutions like universities

### Examples:
- Hyrax

<!--presenter notes

Institutional repositories (sometimes shortened to "IR") manage submission workflows of digital works and provides access to various communities to these works. Institutional repositories are very common at university and other research-focused institutions, and are used to manage and provide access to things like scholarly articles, theses and dissertations, and other research outputs. A good example of an institutional repository system is DSpace, developed in the early 2000s by MIT.

  Digital Asset Management System (DAMS)
</div>

### Key Features:
- Streamlines digital content management
- Specific to media (images, audio, video)

### Examples:
- Orange Logic, ResourceSpace

<!--presenter notes

Digital Asset Management Systems (DAMS) streamline processes involved in managing digital content, including description, tracking, discovery, retrieval,
searching, and distribution of collections of digital objects. Unlike an institutional repository, a DAMS typically will be set up to handle formats beyond research outputs, such as images, audio and video formats. Examples: ResourceSpace

  Content or Collection Management Systems
</div>

### Key Features:
- Maintain descriptive, administrative, location, rights,
and location management data.

### Examples:
- ArchivesSpace
- The Museum System (TMS)
- Aeon

<!--presenter notes

Content Management Systems (CMS) are database applications intended to maintain descriptive and administrative metadata about the physical and digital
collections including records of provenance, acquisition, archival description, rights and location management. Some CMSs allow for storage of digital surrogates for access and management of collections NOT for digital preservation.

</a>

This also might help:

<a href="https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Tools_Grid" target="_blank">COPTR Tools Grid</a>

<!--presenter notes

If you want to take a deep dive into all the systems that are out there, there are a couple of resources to check out. The first one is a crowd-sourced Google Sheet,
“The Collection Management System Collection”, which was kick-started by Ashley Blewer, a preeminent software developer, educator, writer, and artist who has done
incredible work, especially within the field of audio/visual and moving image preservation. In 2017, she made this spreadsheet publicly available for folks in the
field to contribute system descriptions in a matrix form.

Another helpful resource is the Community Owned Digital Preservation Tool Registry (COPTR) Tools Grid, which uses a Wiki format. This grid starts off with a matrix of
general digital preservation object types like “audio” or “ebook” on the Y-axis, and broad digital preservation functional areas on the X-axis. You can click on any of the numbers to see a list of relevant tools for that object type/functional area, and further drill down into other functional area sub-categories. There are nearly 600 tools described in this Wiki.

# Software as a Service (SaaS)

__Software as a Service (SaaS)__ refers to any system that provides its services via the cloud. Rather than having to download software on your desktop PC, you can access this software using an internet browser. The software and all its data are hosted and maintained on remote servers by a third-party provider.

A popular archives-specific example of a SaaS platform is ArchivesSpace. Other examples include Google Drive, Zoom

<!--presenter notes

There are a lot of benefits to using a SaaS system. 
1. Users can access SaaS applications through a web browser, from any device with an internet connection.
2. Maintenance-Free: The service provider manages updates, patches, and security, so users don't need to worry about maintenance.
3. Scalability: Users can scale up or down based on their needs, adjusting usage or subscription plans easily.

SaaS eliminates the need for users to install, manage, and maintain software, making it a convenient and cost-effective solution for many businesses and individuals.

# On-premesis hosting

Sometimes shortened to "on-prem", some institutions resort to hosting their own systems, which means they take responsibility for its maintenance and upgrades.

## Definition
# Open source

__Open source__ refers to software whose source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, modify, distribute, and use it. The key idea behind open-source software is that it promotes collaboration and transparency, enabling developers and users to contribute to its improvement, adapt it to their needs, and share it freely.

Example: ArchivesSpace

# Interoperability and Integrations

<!--presenter notes

In the early days of digital archiving and preservation, a variety of platforms emerged, to better automate, standardize and streamline various processes. Systems like ArchivesSpace emerged, designed with the intention of enabling archivists to accession collections, describe them accurately, and create and publish finding aids. Yet, these systems were built in isolation, tailored to specific tasks without consideration for the full lifecycle of digital records.

-->

---

<!--presenter notes

Let’s imagine that the institution we work at have selected, from a collection, a set hand-written letters for digitization.

The process begins with recording the accession event in ArchivesSpace, then describing the letters to eventually be published as a finding aid.

Let's say, parallel to the archivist processing the letters, the acquiring curator expresses that they wish for the letters to be made available digitally, so that researchers can search the text.

The letters are sent to the photography lab, where each letter is scanned and color corrected, followed by careful renaming and organization into folders. These files were then transferred to a digital asset
management system for curation, and separately, submitted to a digital repository for long-term preservation. Each step in this example different systems, operating independently of one another. The result? A manual, time-consuming effort to link the
digital representations back to their descriptions in ArchivesSpace, often relying on the meticulous work of archivists to ensure accuracy and completeness.
