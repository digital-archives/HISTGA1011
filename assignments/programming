# Scripting Reflection Paper

As the volume of digital materials that collecting institutions acquire grows, it is essential that archivists familiarize themselves with common scripting languages to automate processes that would otherwise be painstaking to do “by hand”. For this assignment, you will spend 3-4 hours learning a programming or scripting language, document your learning process and reflect on the experience. The goal here is not to become an expert developer, but to become comfortable with how archivists employ scripting through their day-to-day work.

Commit to focusing on one programming language. For beginners, select a tutorial for a language you are interested in learning to go through. For those with moderate or advanced experience with scripting, select either a new language to learn or increase your knowledge in a specific area of a language you already know. **Note: Use only free/no-cost tutorials for this assignment (of which there are many). You are not required to spend money on any tutorial(s). If you hit a paywall, simply stop the lesson. Free resources are listed below.**

Free/no-cost programming/scripting languages and resources:

- Python: <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>

- The Programming Historian: <https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/>

- ffmprovisr (ffmpeg): <https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/>

- Bash Scripting: <https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html>

- Practical Technology for Archivists: <https://practicaltechnologyforarchives.org/issue1/>

- OpenRefine + Regular Expression (Regex): [https://openrefine.org/](http://openrefine.org/) 

- Command line: <https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html>

Note: These are not the only tutorials/resources out there, but a place to start. Feel free to use whatever you wish in whatever learning medium you feel most comfortable using such as YouTube, or the non-paywall parts of Coursera, The Odin Project, and others.

Your report should address the following questions:

- What is your background or experience in programming or scripting (if any)?

- Why did you select the language and how did you go about learning it?

- Did you have to install new software or applications to work with it? If so, what?

- What did you learn? 

- What were the challenges or difficulties you faced? How did you try to overcome them?

- What resources did you use to learn the language?

- Why would this language be useful for archives? How would you use it in an archival setting?

- Can you find any examples of an archive or special collections operation using this language? If so, how have they used it for digital archives and what (if any) systems are implicated? Do they document their use of this language? How?

- Will you pursue learning this language further? Another language?

- How was your experience?

- What advice do you have for other archivists?
