Before writing your abstract, you must choose a collection from an existing institution, and within it, either all or a sub-group of materials, that will serve as the foundation for your project. Please see the Selection Criteria section in the Final Project overview for more details. While not required, you are highly encouraged to schedule an on-site or virtual visit with an archivist or other staff at your chosen institution/repository, provided it is feasible for yours and the staff’s schedule. These kinds of conversations should happen early on in the process. This kind of conversation can help inform both your abstract and your final project approach, and also help you to clarify gaps in your understanding of the institution’s existing processes, workflows, policies, and setup.

General Considerations . | In this example, METS embeds PREMIS, meaning some metadata normally in PREMIS standalone files may be handled by METS. | Some expected elements may be missing from the LOC sample file. | . Key Sections in METS . 1. Metadata Wrapping vs. Referencing . | &lt;mets:mdWrap&gt; – Metadata is embedded in the METS document (found in &lt;mets:mdWrap MDTYPE=\"MODS\"&gt; for descriptive metadata and &lt;mets:mdWrap MDTYPE=\"PREMIS\"&gt; for preservation metadata). | &lt;mets:mdRef&gt; – Not present in this file. | . 2. Header . | &lt;mets:metsHdr&gt; which normally indicates the version of METS is missing in this file. I’m not sure why! | The attributes of &lt;mets:mets&gt; show us that the: . | METS version used is ambiguous. I derived this example from the PREMIS XML Usage Examples page. The specific XML file that you used for this assignment is listed as using version 2.1 (I didn’t expect you to figure this out, but in case you were curious!) | PREMIS version used is 2.0 (xmlns:premis=\"info:lc/xmlns/premis-v2\") | MODS version is 3.3 (xmlns:mods=\"http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3\"). | . | . 3. Descriptive Metadata (&lt;mets:dmdSec&gt;) . | Uses MODS as the descriptive metadata standard (&lt;mets:mdWrap MDTYPE=\"MODS\"&gt;). | Title recorded in MODS: [Portrait of Louis Armstrong, between 1938 and 1948]. | Photographer identified: William P. Gottlieb. | Subjects include Louis Armstrong, Jazz musicians, Trumpet players (1930-1950). | . 4. Administrative Metadata (&lt;mets:amdSec&gt;) . | Technical Metadata (&lt;mets:techMD&gt;) – This is repeated twice for two objects, object1 and object2. | Digital Provenance (&lt;mets:digiprovMD&gt;) – This is repeated 7 times, describing different preservation events. | Source Metadata (&lt;mets:sourceMD&gt;) – Not present in this file. | Rights Metadata (&lt;mets:rightsMD&gt;) – Not explicitly included. Instead, we see &lt;mets:mdWrap MDTYPE=\"PREMIS:AGENT\"&gt;, which signals that elements inside &lt;xmlData&gt; should be interpreted using PREMIS rather than METS. | . 5. File Section (&lt;mets:fileSec&gt;) . | Here we see a list of four files. Two are high-resolution TIFF files and another two are lower-resolution JPG files. Each uses &lt;mets:FLocat&gt; (File Location) to point to a URL. | . 6. Structural Map (&lt;mets:structMap&gt;) . | &lt;div&gt; sections: . | File pointers (&lt;fptr&gt;) – Links to files in &lt;fileSec&gt; (e.g., &lt;mets:fptr FILEID=\"masterd1e102963\"/&gt;). | This section bundles together master with service copies (e.g. a masterd1e102963 with serviced1e1029631 and masterd1e102965 with serviced1e102965) | Structural Links (&lt;mets:smLink&gt;) are not present in this file. | Behavior Section (&lt;mets:behavior&gt;) is not present in this file. | . | . PREMIS (Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies) . Note: Most PREMIS within this file does not declare a namespace (e.g. &lt;premis: preceeding an element name. Instead, the PREMIS is “wrapped” using &lt;mets:mdWrap MDTYPE=\"PREMIS:AGENT\"&gt;: tags found within are interpreted as as PREMIS.) .

Your task is to examine the contents of each and try to identify how they are broken. | Some changes may be obvious, while others may be subtle. You may need to look at certain files within the SIP/bag, like the manifest, to determine what went wrong. | . 4. Submit your activity summary in Brightspace . In the Assignments section of Brightspace, please prepare and attach a document with your answers to the following questions: . | What do you think I altered? | What did you examine to figure this out? What clues did you find that told you something went wrong? | Optional: If you couldn’t find exactly what went wrong, were there any differences, in general, between the two SIP/bags, that you noticed? What were they? | From a broader perspective, what rules or policies might a repository put in place to ensure data submitted to it is in tact? | . 5. Discuss your findings in class . Come prepared for Week 3’s class to spend 2-3 minutes discussing your experience investigating what went wrong. I will also reveal to you what I altered, so you can compare your findings with my doings! . ",

The purpose of the assignment is to learn how the elements of a simple METS record work together and how preservation metadata derived from the PREservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) can be used to document preservation activities and changes to the item over time. The activity involves saving a record containing rich METS records locally and annotating that METS record to describe the major components of the METS record, including PREMIS components. The net result of the activity is a demonstration of the capability to “read” METS and PREMIS records and explain what happened to the item. ",

What this means is, though you do not necessarily need to emulate this structure and sequence exactly, it should show to you what I will be looking for when I review your work. 1. Introduction . This could include a high-level overview of: . | The problem or goal your Plan addresses | What collection/materials your Plan addresses | Summary of your proposed approach and expected outcomes | . 2. Rationale . Explain why your institution is prioritizing this collection over others. Consider: . | Long-term impact or benefit on research, researchers, students, patrons, teaching, public programming, social movements, deliberately marginalized people and their histories, or anything else | Circulation and usage statistics and how your Plan may increase engagement | Physical fragility of materials and how digital surrogates may reduce their wear and tear | Increasing institutional compliance with national preservation standards | Alignment with overall institutional goals and priorities | . 3. Stakeholders, People doing the work . List staff, departments, or external partners involved in your project. For each, specify: . | Their role and responsibilities; how each staff will contribute to the project’s success and sustainability | Staff and skillsets required to do the work (this might include engaging with specialized vendors to do specialized work like digitization) | Workspace and technical setup; what equipment/tools/programs are needed if the work is to be done onsite. | . 4. Scope &amp; Inventory . Provide a summary of your collection’s form and extent. | Describe the collection as a whole (formats, volume, content types) | Describe the materials within the collection that will be worked on and made accessible online | What might be out of scope (e.g., commercial recordings, duplicate materials) | . 5. Selection Criteria/Prioritization . Describe why these materials are being chosen and prioritized for access. Consider: . | Format and condition | Copyright and legal restrictions | Dependence on specific and/or obsolete hardware/software to play or render contents | Institutional priorities or legal obligations | An upcoming event or milestone to which this work might speak to or support (repositories often use events like this to spur work and drum up funding) | Bolstering usage of materials | Addressing and managing archival backlogs | . 6. Preservation Approach . Describe your methodology and cite national standards and best practices where applicable. If you depart from existing practices, explain why and how your approach remains interoperable. Consider: . | Your chosen institution’s setup: you can choose to go with their approach, which is fine, but I would like you to justify this. What about their setup/policy/practice aligns with your Plan’s vision? | You may diverge from how your chosen institution would normally approach this work. You may, in this case, look to other institutions’ policies and practices for inspiration. In this case, you should justify what your chosen institution might change or implement to support your Plan. | . 7. End-to-End Workflow . Outline the full workflow for your project, covering: . | Appraisal, acquisition and accessioning/transfer | Archival processing/description (though you will be working with already-processes materials, it is likely that the finding aid may require updating once materials are made available online) | Digitization (in-house and/or vendor-based) | Packaging materials for submission; Ingest and creation of AIPs and DIPs | Long-term storage systems, backups/redundancy | Additional processing (optical character recognition, auto-transcription/translation, normalization, quality control, rights clearance) | Long-term preservation strategies (fixity, disaster planning) | . Ensure this section aligns with any visualizations/diagrams/workflows in the appendix and in your presentation. 8. Discovery, Access &amp; Use . Explain how users currently access materials at your institution. Here you may identify successes of the current systems, and/or limitations (e.g., discoverability, user experience, metadata structure, interoperability across various online systems). Compare access models at other institutions and discuss how similar approaches could improve your institution’s access strategy, or suggest improvements to the user experience, features, and functionality. 9. Technical Specifications &amp; Standards . | Software and hardware: Identify tools used in your Plan’s workflow | File formats: Define submission, preservation, and access formats for your selected materials | Resolution and sample rates: Outline minimum standards for digitized files based on the institutions’ policies/practices (or suggest your own based on national standards) | Quality control: Describe how files will be assessed after transfer or digitization | Metadata: Identify schemas for descriptive, administrative, preservation, technical, and access/catalog metadata | Access platform: Explain how users will interact with the collection as far as platforms, viewers | Rights and restrictions: Discuss potential copyright or privacy concerns | . 10. Front-End Experience . Describe who your intended users are and how they will engage with the collection. Consider: . | User characteristics and needs | Features that will support discovery and access | Format-specific requirements (e.g., viewers/playback platforms for specific formats) | How the digital experience will replicate or enhance the physical experience | . 11. Anticipated Challenges . Identify potential obstacles and how you plan to address them, including: . | Material-specific challenges | Workflow or policy gaps | Budget and resource constraints | Technical limitations | Sustainability concerns | Resourcing/staffing up/skilling up | Legal or rights-based risks | Gaps in policy or practice | .

    "content": "Why scripting? . With the pace at which institutions are acquiring born-digital materials, or digitizing analog materials, archivists often encounter tasks that are otherwise very time-consuming or ultra tedious to perform manually. Scripting is sometimes turned to as a way to do things quickly and accurately, at scale. Scripts have been written by archivists, some who are seasoned developers, others who are not. While you don’t need to be a full-fledged programmer to work in a modern repository, having a basic understanding of what scripting can do can help you to at least imagine ways to better automate and manage repetitive processes. For this activity, you’ll explore a real-life example of code used by a repository and translate it into pseudocode. Think of pseudocode as plain, conversational language that explains the steps a script takes to accomplish its task. ",

    "content": "1. Select a script . | In class, you’ll choose one Python* script from Ruth Tillman’s ArchivesSnake GitHub repository to work with. Each script performs a small job using the Python programming language and the ArchivesSnake Library. Try to choose one that is no more than 50 lines. | A Python script file will end with .py (e.g., download-subjects.py). | . 2. Get to know the script . | Open your chosen script by clicking its name. | Read the script from top to bottom. Don’t worry at this point about understanding exactly what it’s doing. This is just a way to get acquainted with its length, any comments made by the author, and see if there’s anything that initially makes sense. One of Python’s strengths is that it is written to be more human readable that other scripting languages. Try to find those things! | Ruth conveniently wrote these scripts in “chunks”, in the same way written stories are broken up into paragraphs (with a line break in between each chunk). Try first to hash out what you think the chunk is doing. Note: lines starting with # denote what are known as “comments”. They’re there to explain what the code is doing! Please pay special attention to them. There are also descriptions for (some) of the scripts in her main ASpaceASnake page that might also be helpful for you (just please note, not all scripts have a description). | Once you’ve tried out describing what each chunk does, go back and look up terms/script parts that are unfamiliar and fill out your pseudocode. | . 3. Use scripting resources . You are encouraged to use any resource to help you understand the code: . | Preferred: Official Python documentation such as the Python Built-in Functions document (this will only contain details for information that comes with a standard Python install. For more specific libraries, you will need to consult other documentation such as ArchivesSnake). | Online Communities (e.g., Stack Overflow) | Video Tutorials (e.g., YouTube) | Generative AI (e.g., chatbots - I don’t exactly encourage this but it’s inevitable that generative AI information will appear, even if you do a basic web browser search.) | Cold browser search (e.g. typing in and searching for “what does [this term/script step] mean?” in a browser application) | . You don’t need to cite your sources. The goal is to understand what the script is doing, not to write a formal paper. 4. Write your pseudocode . | Follow the structure from this week’s slide deck: code on one side, pseudocode on the other. | Example pseudocode: “This line checks if a folder exists. If it doesn’t, it creates a folder.” | . 5. If you’re confused, pseudo-note it! . If you’re unsure about any part of the script, it’s okay! Feel free to note it in your pseudocode: . “I think this line initializes a connection to a server, but I’m not entirely sure.” . Uncertainty is part of learning, and you’re not expected to deeply dissect every detail. When we discuss your findings next week, we can go over parts that confused you. Please note: I will not be grading you on whether or not your pseudocode is correct. Instead, I want to see you made an effort to figure out, on a high-level, what the script was trying to accomplish. 6. Submit your pseudocode . | Spend 1-2 hours tops on this activity. Don’t overthink it! The point is to try and warm up to what Python code looks like, and learn a little bit more about its syntax and how archivists have used it to do their work. | Submit your pseudocode to Brightspace by Sunday night. | Use clear formatting to separate code from pseudocode for easy readability. Suggestion: Use a two-column “table” using a word processing or slide deck application. | . 7. Prepare to share . Be ready to discuss your pseudocode in class next week. Each student will take 2-3 minutes to discuss: . | What Ruth was trying to accomplish. | What they used to figure out its behavior (web browser search? A #Comment? ArchivesSnake documentation? Asked a student/friend/colleague?). | What was confusing or unclear and why. | Any other takeaways you would like to share. | . ",

Participation is graded across three areas: 1.) pre-class reading reactions, 2.) in-class participation and discussion, and 3.) in-class/asynchronous activities. Pre-class reading reactions: 10 points . Each week, you will receive a set of readings and additional materials that require your review and response in the Brightspace “Discussions” section. Locate the topic titled “Week [#] - Pre-Class Reading Reactions” corresponding to the current week. It is essential to submit your weekly post by 3:30 PM on Wednesdays. Your response should encompass all the assigned readings and materials collectively. Ensure that your post includes the following three parts: . | Aha! Share something new that you learned. | What? Mention something that you didn’t fully understand. | More! Highlight a topic you would like to further discuss in class. | . During our class sessions, we will allocate 10-15 minutes to discuss these reactions as a group. Regarding grading, I will evaluate the completion and quality of your posts each week, focusing on content rather than your writing style. In-class discussions: 10 points . To fully engage in the course, it is expected that you come to class having completed all assigned readings and actively participate in classroom discussions and activities. For weeks when we have guest speakers or field trips, please come prepared with at least one question to ask the speaker. If you are unable to attend class or need to participate remotely, please send an email to me by Wednesday 3:30 PM. You do not need to provide a detailed explanation or excuse, a simple “I cannot make class” will suffice. Although a Zoom link will be available on Brightspace for each class as an option, please note that class sessions are primarily conducted in-person by default. In-class activities: 10 points . Most weeks we will work on an in-class activity together as a group. The objective of these activities is to provide you with practical experience using the tools and processes employed in digital archiving and preservation. Activity instructions and supplementary files are kept in the Activities folder. If you are unable to complete the activity during class time, you will be responsible for completing it outside of class hours and submitting your results in Brightspace by the following Sunday. The format for submitting your results may vary each week, ranging from written documents, worksheets, spreadsheets, or something else. While individual submission is expected, you are encouraged to work together and collaborate with your classmates. ",
