# Final Project

## Overview

For your final project, you will develop a **Digitization and Access Plan** (referred to here on out as the "Plan") for a group of currently inaccessible materials of your choosing. This will take the form of a **written paper** and an **accompanying presentation**, which you will deliver on the last day of class.

To guide your progress, you will submit an **abstract** mid-way through the semester as a check-in to ensure you have identified a suitable group of materials to work with, and are on track with your project. (See the <a href="https://digital-archives.github.io/HISTGA1011/schedule/" target="_blank">class schedule</a> for details.)

## Scenario

_You are an archivist working in the special collections department of [organization/institution of your choice]. As part of an initiative to enhance digital access, you have identified a collection that contains **materials/records that are currently inaccessible to users online**. This might include undigitized analog media and/or born-digital media._

_Recognizing your expertise in digital preservation workflow management, the Director of Special Collections has appointed you as **Project Lead**. Your task is to analyze how your institution currently handles digital access and preservation, write out a plan describing how these selected materials will be made accessible online, and present this plan to the Special Collections Committee (i.e. represented by your fellow classmates)._

## ðŸ“Œ Selection Criteria

To ensure a well-rounded project, your chosen collection must meet the following criteria:

- **Your collection must be described by an existing online archival finding aid.**
- Though you will be choosing collection materials already in an existing institution's holdings and described in an online finding aid, the materials themselves should have **not already been made available online**. This will require browsing finding aids and determining/making sure those materials are otherwise not available through a digital library/collection website.
- You do not have to propose a plan for all components of a finding aid (unless you want to!). You will need to deliberately select groups of materials (e.g., one series, or one type of format.)
- While some **flat materials** (e.g., photographs, maps, manuscripts) may be included, **your project cannot focus exclusively on paper-based materials that only require scanning or photography.**
- Your project must engage with at least **one other non-paper based format**, such as:
  - **Magnetic recorded media** (e.g., audiotapes, videotapes, floppy disks, hard drives)
  - **Optical media** (e.g., CDs, DVDs)
  - **Born-digital records** requiring file format migration or emulation (software, database records)

## Project Goals

Your final paper and presentation should:
- **Demonstrate the significance** of the materials you selected and why it should be prioritized for access.
- **Articulate the technical, labor and logistical considerations** of the process of not only getting the materials online, but also promoting their discovery and access.
- **Explain how the project aligns with institutional priorities** and contributes to broader digital preservation and archiving efforts.

This project is an opportunity to apply digital archiving and preservation principles in a real-world context, critically engage with selection and access strategies, and develop skills in planning and advocacy within archival institutions.
